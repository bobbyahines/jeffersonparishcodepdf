<p>Street classifications (in hierarchical order):
(1)
Interstate (freeway) shall mean a street primarily designed to move high volumes of traffic, at a high rate of
speed, between cities, parishes and states, with no traffic signals or grade separated interchanges, and with
limited, highly controlled access. No direct property access is provided to these corridors and the corridor may
also contain service roads. Also called an interstate highway, limited access highway, or thruway, and is
identified as interstate (freeway) upon the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan. Interstates are federal routes that
are state-maintained and are part of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways.
(2)
Major arterial shall mean a street primarily designed to move traffic between cities or parishes. These streets
have traffic signals at intersection with other arterials, collectors, driveways, or local streets, and may be
designated for limited access. These streets may be higher speed, provide access to the interstate highway
network within cities, may run through downtown areas, and may contain service roads. On-street parking, and
loading and unloading of vehicles are generally discouraged along these streets. Identified as a major arterial
upon the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan.
(3)
Minor arterial shall mean a street primarily designed to move traffic from neighborhoods through an area. These
streets have traffic signals at intersections with other minor arterials, collectors, large driveways or local streets.
These streets occasionally form boundaries for neighborhood areas. In some locations, these streets may have
on-street parking, loading, or unloading areas. Identified as a minor arterial upon the Jefferson Parish
Thoroughfare Plan.
(4)</p>
<p>Collector street shall mean a street which moves traffic between neighborhoods or from the core of the
neighborhood to its edge. In a typical suburban area, these streets may carry some through traffic if located
adjacent to a community facility (school, park, library, community center, fire station). These streets generally
have no traffic signals, and may have either stop sign or signal control. Signals may be found at an intersection
with a minor or major arterial. Identified as a collector street upon the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan.
(5)
Neighborhood collector shall mean a street which provides access to residences, public facilities such as schools,
recreational centers, fire and police stations, and parks located within neighborhoods. Identified as a
neighborhood collector upon the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan.
(6)
Local street shall mean a street constructed to established standards, as specified in the subdivision regulations
of this code, and intended primarily to provide direct property access and serving local, as distinct from through,
traffic, with on-street parking generally permitted. Identified as a local street upon the Jefferson Parish
Thoroughfare Plan.
Street, private means every way, street, place, or strip of land in private ownership giving vehicle access from a
public right-of-way to one (1) or more properties, or buildings in separate or joint ownership used for vehicular
travel by the owner or owners and those having express or implied permission from the owner or owners,
including but not limited to public service utility vehicles, fire fighting apparatus, police vehicles, and waste
disposal vehicles; a private road is a road whose use by the public is controlled by owner or owners thereof. Also
called private road.
Way means a road, path, or track affording passage from one place to another.
(Ord. No. 23233, § 2, 1-23-08; Ord. No. 23292, § 38, 5-7-08)</p>
<h5 id="sec-29-02-street-names-and-characteristics">Sec. 29-0.2. - Street names and characteristics.</h5>
<p>(a)
When the provisions of this Code are intended to address the movement of vehicular traffic, the nomenclature
utilized classifies public ways into four (4) basic categories of street or road: 1) interstates (freeways), 2) arterial
streets, 3) collector streets, and 4) local streets. Interstates (freeways), arterial streets, and collector streets are
identified as such on the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan.
(b)
When the provisions of this Code are intended to address the physical infrastructure of the public ways, the term
"street" is utilized and it encompasses avenues, boulevards, parkways, roads, thoroughfares, alleys, lanes,
viaducts, public servitudes and all other public ways or parts thereof, including medians, neutral grounds,
roadways, pedestrian islands, roadsides and sidewalks for purposes of vehicular, pedestrian and bicycle travel
ways.
The official name ascribed to any public way, including but not limited to such words as "street," "road,"
"avenue," "boulevard," "parkway," "highway," "lane," "circle," "place," "drive," "circle," "court" or however
otherwise designated, in any plat, survey, dedication, ordinance or map, does not necessarily indicate any
descriptive or distinctive type of public way that such terms may otherwise invoke through common or
customary usage.
(Ord. No. 23233, § 2, 1-23-08; Ord. No. 23292, § 39, 5-7-08)</p>

<p>(a)
The department of streets shall issue all permits for any work, excavation, or activity required by this Article I.
of this chapter and the fees for said permits shall be calculated according to the provisions for calculating
construction permit fees under section 35.5-60 of the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances.
(b)
Whenever a permit for any work, excavation, or activity is required by this chapter, it shall be a misdemeanor
and a violation of this section for any person to commence or continue said work, excavation or activity without
having first obtained such permit.
(c)

property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the applicant's property is located; and the director shall

Sidewalks constructed of poured-in-place Portland cement concrete shall have contraction joints scored or sawcut to a depth of three-fourths (¾) of an inch at four-foot intervals. Expansion joints shall be placed at maximum
intervals of twenty (20) feet. All sidewalk intersections at street corners shall be bounded by expansion joints.
Expansion joints shall consist of one-half-inch or three-fourths-inch thick premoulded expansion material or
three-fourths-inch thick treated timber. Expansion joints must completely separate adjoining concrete slabs.
There shall be no concrete-to-concrete contact at an expansion joint. Expansion joints must have a minimum of
three (3) No. 10 common galvanized nails projecting completely through the expansion material into the
concrete on each side of the joint. The nails act as mini dowels to hold expansion material in place and prevent
vertical displacement of adjoining slabs. Sidewalk expansion joints and edges shall be rounded with an edging
tool having a one-half-inch radius.
(d)
All newly constructed or reconstructed sidewalks at corner locations shall include a curb ramp for the
handicapped which provides gently sloped access to the street from the sidewalk, and vice versa, for elderly and
physically disabled persons.
(e)
Curb ramps for the handicapped shall be constructed in accordance with plans and specifications available from
the department of engineering or with other plans which have been approved by the director of engineering. The
slope of the ramp shall be no greater than eight (8) percent. This equals approximately nine and one-half (9½)
inches in ten (10) feet. Since construction of a curb ramp requires modification of existing curb on the street,
plans for curb ramps must be approved by the director of engineering.
(f)
Sidewalks constructed of brick or concrete pavers set in mortar are rigid structures; therefore, they must utilize
the same type of joints and joint spacing requirements as for poured-in-place concrete sidewalks. Expansion
joint material must be flush with top surface of pavers. The scoring of joints will apply to concrete base. It is
desirable that an unmortared joint be left between the pavers at each scored joint to control reflective cracking.
(g)
Sidewalks constructed of brick pavers or concrete pavers over a sand base do not require special joints of any
type since, in effect, a joint exists between each paver. After pavers are set, sweep sand over surface to fill voids
in joints between pavers.
(h)
Standard brick and concrete pavers have no holes and are generally twice as long as they are wide to obtain the
greatest variety of patterns. Dimensions should be approximately eight (8) inches long, approximately four (4)
inches wide and approximately two (2) inches thick, Regular brick, without holes, may be substituted for pavers,
but the variety of patterns will be limited if their length is not twice their width.
(i)
Pavers will require 2 × 6 treated timber edge restraints, set on edge, four (4) feet apart, to establish sidewalk with
and keep the pavers from separating. The top of the 2 × 6 must be approximately one (1) inch below finished
grade of sidewalk, Edge restraint timbers should be purchased in lengths of eight (8) or ten (10) feet for ease in
handling. Edge restraints must be anchored in place with pointed 2 × 4 treated timber stakes, twelve (12) to
fifteen (15) inches long, spaced approximately four (4) feet apart and nailed to the 2 × 6 with No. 8 or No. 10
common galvanized nails. The tops of stakes must be approximately one (1) inch below the top of the edge of
the restraint.
(j)
The compacted sand base between edge restraints must be at least four (4) inches deep. Compaction is achieved
by saturating with water, At driveway locations, the compacted sand base must be at least six (6) inches deep.
(k)
It shall be unlawful to construct a sidewalk in the sidewalk space or adjoining servitude until the alignment and
elevation thereof have been established by the department of engineering.
(l)
All sidewalks constructed in the sidewalk space or adjoining servitude must comply with the specifications
provided herein and any plans and specifications that the department of public works may, by rule, require. The
department of engineering will provide standard plans to supplement these specifications, upon request.
