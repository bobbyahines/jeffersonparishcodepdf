Subject to the availability of unencumbered appropriated funds, the parish will indemnify and save harmless any
parish officer or employee against any and all claims, demands, suits, and judgments of sums of money
instituted by or awarded in favor of any third person growing out of, resulting from, or incurred by reason of any
good faith act and/or omission of the officer or employee in connection with the lawful discharge or
performance of his/her duties as an officer or employee of the parish, expressly excluding any acts or omissions

criminal proceedings which result in a conviction for an offense or which result in a grant of immunity from

(b)
In civil actions, parish employees will be entitled to legal representation in the defense of the allegations and
claims made in any lawsuit covered by subsection (a) of this section. Such defense will be provided at no cost to
the parish officer or employee. Representation will generally be provided by the parish attorney's office.
However, in the judgment of the parish attorney or of a court, when certain circumstances warrant that the
interests of the parish and/or officer or employee would be better served through the acquisition of private
counsel, the law department will relinquish its defense obligations in favor of a private attorney provided at the
parish's expense, for reasonable and customary fees approved by the parish attorney, with said parish attorney
having the option to be co-counsel of record.

<p>(a)
A parish officer or employee may request the use of private counsel for the defense of a lawsuit when he/she is
sued personally and would be held personally liable for payment of any damages awarded in an unfavorable
judgment.
(b)
Before an officer or employee employs private counsel, he/she must obtain prior written approval from the
parish attorney's office. Failure to obtain such prior written approval may result in imposition of the
responsibility for payment of legal fees and costs upon the officer or employee. (See subsection (e) of this
section.) Even when such approval is granted, the employee may have to pay for initial retainer fees and other
expenses before being reimbursed by the parish for these amounts.
(c)
The parish attorney's office will coordinate the defense of all cases. An officer's or employee's appointing
authority should forward to the law department photocopies of any petitions or other papers in a lawsuit in
which the parish and/or any of its former or current employees are involved immediately upon receipt of these
documents.
(d)
It is the officer's or employee's responsibility to notify his/her appointing authority of any actual or potential
litigation and of any action or development in existing litigations as soon as he/she becomes aware of the same.
(e)
If private counsel is obtained by an officer or employee without the prior written consent of the law department
or if an officer or employee violates the rules of subsections (f) and (g) of this section, then the employee will be
solely responsible for the payment of all attorney's fees and costs and other expenses. Additionally, the parish in
such a case will not be obliged to indemnify and save the officer or employee harmless from any judgment or
other liability incurred by the officer or employee or his/her private attorney. The law department may grant
exemptions from the application of this rule if subsequent approval for the hiring of private counsel is issued and
if the law department finds that the failure to obtain prior approval has not prejudiced the parish's interest.
(f)
The officer or employee who is represented by private counsel should keep a log of all services rendered by the
private counsel and of any meetings or correspondence. These records will assist the parish in the payment of
reasonable and customary costs of the officer's or employee's representation by private counsel.
(g)
To the extent that the law permits and with due regard for the fundamental rights of the officers and employees
of the parish, each officer or employee involved in civil litigation shall be obliged to cooperate as much as is
reasonably possible with the parish and its attorneys in the defense of civil litigation.

(b)
Definition. As used in this section, the word "board" shall be interpreted to mean any board, commission,
committee or authority created by the parish council either by ordinance or resolution.
(c)
Standards for creation. All boards established by the council shall be established by either ordinance or
resolution. A resolution shall be used where the board is to be advisory in nature and does not have authority to
implement its recommendation without further action of the council. An ordinance shall be used when the board
is to have independent authority to carry out policies and objectives and establish procedures without the express
ratification of the council. An ordinance shall also be used where it is otherwise legally required or advisable.
(d)
Length of existence. All boards hereafter established will cease to exist twelve (12) months after their
establishment if established by resolution or forty-eight (48) months if established by ordinance, provided that
the council, in the ordinance or resolution creating a board may specify a lesser or greater period for the life of
the board. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if a board remains active beyond what would otherwise be
the expiration date of that board and the resolution or ordinance creating the board did not specify a lesser or
greater period for the life of the board, then that board shall exist until the date of last action by the board or until
the council specifically terminates the board, whichever occurs first. Council termination shall occur by
resolution if the board were created by resolution or by ordinance if the board were created by ordinance.
(e)
Designation of chairperson(s). The ordinance and resolution establishing a board shall indicate the party or
parties who will serve as chairperson(s). As an exception to this requirement, a board may be empowered to
elect its own chairperson(s) in the ordinance or resolution establishing the board.
(f)
Designation of office of primary responsibility. Each ordinance or resolution establishing a board shall indicate
the parish office, department or agency which shall serve as the focal point for inquiries or actions concerning
the board.
(g)
Terms of office. Each ordinance or resolution establishing a board shall set forth the term of office of the various
members. The length of the term shall be consistent with the purpose of the board and the other provisions of
this section. If a member is appointed to fill a vacancy, this member shall serve until the expiration of term for
which the vacated member was appointed. The council may in the ordinance or resolution establishing a board,
establish other provisions as to terms or the filling of vacancies. However, if the board is terminated, either
pursuant to provisions of subsection (d) or other action, the membership of the board shall be automatically
terminated.
(h)
Approval of membership. All members of all boards created by the parish council shall be subject to the
approval of the parish council and the terms of the members shall end at the expiration of the term of the council
which appointed the membership, provided that the ordinance or resolution establishing the board may specify
otherwise as relates to the approval of membership and terms of office. However, nothing herein shall affect the
authority of a council to reconstitute any board with new membership during the council's term of office.
(i)
Exception. This section shall not apply to any boards, committees, commissions and authorities to which the
council merely appoints members or representatives.

Evaluation criteria. Specific evaluation criteria shall be developed and stated in the RFP, considering the goal of
the RFP process stated in section (1) above, and the foregoing elements of the RFP. Said evaluation criteria shall
be crafted to measure how well a proposer's approach meets the desired performance requirements, and which
permit analysis of whether the proposer's methodology meets the minimum stated performance standards,
considering required technical expertise and experience, and managerial capability. A scoring system shall be
devised to be impartially applied to each proposal.
b.
Weighting. Once developed, each evaluation criterion shall be scaled or weighted in relative order of importance
to the overall RFP procurement action, and which shall be stated in percentages or points in the finalized RFP.
The cost evaluation shall be worth twenty-five (25) percent of the total points assigned.
c.
Pricing. In addition to the foregoing, the RFP shall require pricing or cost of the item(s) or service(s) to be
procured in defined format to allow like comparison and/or line item cost analysis. Such pricing schedule(s)
shall be submitted with the proposer's RFP response in separate sealed envelopes. The cost evaluation, described
in section 7. below, shall take place after completion of the technical evaluation.
(4)
Public notice. Upon adoption of the authorizing resolution and approval of the completed RFP in accordance
with section (2) above, the Jefferson Parish purchasing department shall provide public notice of the RFP by
advertising the same in the official journal of the parish, a minimum of one (1) time each week for not less than
three (3) consecutive weeks. In addition to the official journal of the parish, said public notice may likewise be
advertised in appropriate national trade journal(s) as necessary. The advertisement of the intended procurement
action shall include at a minimum, a brief description of the item(s) or service(s) to be procured, a description of
the evaluation criteria as stated in the RFP, and a stipulated date and time after which proposals shall no longer
be accepted.
(5)
Questions and written correspondence. Proposers may submit written questions and correspondence in
accordance with the schedule defined in the approved RFP. Only timely received written correspondence shall
be considered by the parish. In the event that answers to questions materially change or substantially clarify the
RFP, the Jefferson Parish purchasing department shall issue formal addenda to the RFP. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, addenda to an RFP may not materially or substantially change the statement of work, scope of
service, or the RFP evaluation criteria.
(6)
Response(s) to RFP. All responses to an RFP shall be submitted electronically through the Jefferson Parish eprocurement system and shall be due on or before the advertised date and time deadline for receipt, provided that
date shall not be less than thirty (30) days after the date of the first of three (3) consecutive weekly publications
in the official parish journal as defined in Section (4) above. Late proposals shall be rejected and shall not
receive further consideration. Proposals should be submitted on the most favorable technical terms which the
proposer is able to submit, and at the best price for which the proposer is able to submit. Each person or firm
submitting an RFP proposal must submit with their proposal:
a.
An affidavit by the proposer attesting: (i) that the affiant has not and will not employ any person either directly
or indirectly to secure the public contract under which he is to receive payment, other than persons regularly
employed by the affiant whose service in connection with the project or in securing the public contract are in the
regular course of their duties for the affiant; and (ii) that no part of the contract price was paid or will be paid to
any person for soliciting the contract other than payment of normal compensation to persons regularly employed
by the affiant whose services with the project are in the regular course of their duties for the affiant; and
b.
An affidavit by the proposer attesting to: (i) any and all campaign contributions that the affiant has made to
elected officials of the parish during the current term; and (ii) any and all debts owed by the affiant to any
elected or appointed official of the parish, and any and debts owed by any elected or appointed official of the
parish to the affiant; and (iii) that the affiant has not made any contribution to or in support of elected officials of
the parish through or in the name of another person or firm either directly or indirectly. For purposes of this
section, elected or appointed officials of the parish shall be limited to members of the Jefferson Parish Council
and the parish president; and
c.
An affidavit by the proposer identifying any and all subcontractors, and/or persons, excluding full-time
employees, who may assist in providing the item(s) and/or service(s) under any ensuing RFP agreement.
Preplaced emergency contracts, as defined by section 2-917, shall be exempted from submitting the affidavit
described in this provision, section 2-895(6)c; however, a list of all subcontractors used in the performance of
the preplaced emergency contracts shall be submitted prior to payment on the contract.
d.
Failure to timely submit the affidavits defined in (a) through (c) above in completed and notarized form shall
result in the proposer's submission being deemed nonresponsive by the RFP evaluation committee, and said
submission shall receive no further consideration.
(7)
Evaluation and evaluation committee. Timely received proposals shall be individually evaluated by the RFP
evaluation committee based upon the approved evaluation criteria defined in the advertised RFP. The step-bystep evaluation and the stated objective of the RFP evaluation is to insure that all proposals receive impartial and
equitable consideration, considering the goal defined in subsection (1) above. Except as where otherwise
provided by law, all RFP evaluation meetings shall comply with Louisiana's Open Meetings Law, LSA-R.S.
42:4.1 et seq. and all proposers are encouraged to attend the noticed evaluation meeting(s), as the evaluation
committee may determine that discussions are necessary for clarification of submitted materials. However,
requests for written submissions shall be required from all proposers uniformly and considered by the evaluation
committee. Any departure from this evaluation procedure which is prompted by external factors necessitating
departure shall be permitted only insofar as the same treatment is impartially extended to all proposers.
a.
Reporting. The secretary of the RFP evaluation committee shall prepare and forward to the Jefferson Parish
Council a memorandum identifying the responsive and nonresponsive proposals, identifying the responsible and
nonresponsible proposers, and explaining the rationale for the scores assigned. Attached to the memorandum
shall be copies of the price proposals received in accordance with (c) below, along with any analysis or
clarification completed regarding those pricing criteria. Responsibility of a proposer is determined in the same
manner as for competitive sealed bids, and the responsiveness of a proposal shall be determined considering the
materials that the proposer has submitted and the core requirements of the RFP.
b.
Evaluation committee. The RFP evaluation committee shall be comprised of one (1) representative from each of
the following: (i) the requesting department; (ii) the research and budget office of the Council; (iii) the
purchasing department; (iv) the finance department; (v) an attorney from the office of the parish attorney, subject
to the limitations defined in (d) below. Additional employees of Jefferson Parish may only be appointed as
members of a particular RFP evaluation committee if authorized in the authorizing resolution defined in
subsection (2) above.
c.
Price proposals. After completion and tallying of the technical evaluation scores, each scoring evaluation
committee member shall sign and date his individual score sheet. After the secretary of the evaluation committee
collects all individual score sheets, the purchasing department representative and the requesting department
representative shall tally the individual scores to obtain a total technical evaluation score for each proposer.
Following the tabulation of technical scores, the purchasing department representative shall open the sealed
pricing proposals, and shall read the pertinent portions of those pricing proposals aloud. To the extent necessary,
the evaluation committee may further review and analyze the cost proposals and/or request and receive
clarification of the pricing information provided by the proposers for submission to the council. After discussion
of all price proposals, the finance department representative shall calculate the cost evaluation portion of the
scoring sheet, using the pricing proposals submitted by proposers and the formula below. The cost evaluation
shall constitute twenty-five (25) percent of the total points assigned, and will be based upon standard cost rates
submitted by the proposers. The proposer with the lowest cost shall receive the highest cost evaluation score.
Other proposers will receive a cost score computed as follows:
CS = (LPC/PC * X)
Where:
CS = Computed cost score for Proposer
LPC = Lowest proposed cost of all Proposers
PC = Proposer's cost
X = 25% of the total number of points assigned.
After the finance department representative completes the cost evaluation scores, the purchasing department
representative and the requesting department representative shall each add the cost evaluation scores for each
proposer to the tabulated technical scores of each proposer, totaling the final number of points assigned to each
proposer. The tabulated score sheet shall be signed and dated by the purchasing department representative and
the requesting department representative. The secretary of the evaluation committee shall collect all individual
and tabulated score sheets and deliver them to the council clerk.
d.
Parish attorney. The representative from the office of the parish attorney shall act as a nonevaluating member
and secretary of the RFP evaluation committee. In addition to the reporting requirements defined in (a) above,
the secretary shall keep written minutes of the evaluation meeting, and shall act as liaison between the
evaluation committee and any proposer(s). Any correspondence from proposers shall be directed to the secretary
of the evaluation committee.
(8)
Selection and award. Upon the communication of the evaluation results, the secretary of the evaluation
committee shall prepare and route to the department requesting the RFP for placement on the council agenda a
resolution (with a blank for the name of the proposer(s) to be selected by council) selecting the proposer(s) to
supply the nonstandard item(s) or perform the statement of work or scope of services; and directing the Parish
administration to negotiate favorable contractual terms in accordance with the scope of the RFP and the
proposer's written proposal. The Jefferson Parish Council shall review the memorandum, scoring sheets, and
pricing proposals received from the secretary of the evaluation committee and shall complete its analysis for
selection of the proposer(s) under the RFP procurement action. Upon completion of its analysis, the council may
either (i) adopt the resolution selecting the proposer(s) to supply the nonstandard item(s) or perform the
statement of work or scope of services; or (ii) reject all proposals. The council shall select the proposal which
received the highest cumulative score from the evaluation committee; except that the council may select a
proposer other than the highest-ranked proposer provided that proposer selected has been given a cumulative
score by the committee that is no more than ten (10) percent lower than the cumulative score for the highestranked proposer.
(9)
Ratification of contract. After negotiating all terms, conditions and pricing most favorable to the Parish of
Jefferson, considering the type of agreement, period for performance and quality of the item(s) and/or service(s)
being procured, the parish administration shall submit the proposed agreement in final form to the council for
ratification. In the event that favorable terms and conditions cannot be successfully negotiated by the Parish
administration, or to the extent that council fails to ratify the proposed agreement, the parish attorney's office
shall seek authorization from the parish council to negotiate favorable terms and conditions with another
responsive and responsible proposer under that proposed RFP procurement action.
(10)
Louisiana Public Records Act compliance. Except as where otherwise provided by law, all documents submitted
to the parish under an RFP are subject to Louisiana's Public Records Law, LSA-R.S. 44:1 et seq. and may be
released when a public records request is made in accordance with those provisions.
(11)
Contracts for the collection of garbage and trash. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary contained above,
Jefferson Parish may procure nonexclusive contracts for the collection of garbage and trash by use of the public
bid process, the request for proposal process, or by negotiation as provided for in R.S. 33:4169.1.

Inclusion of the name of a vendor or business on such list does not indicate whether the vendor or business is
responsible in respect to a particular procurement or otherwise capable of successfully performing a contract.
(b)
Public availability. Names and addresses on general bidder lists shall be available for public inspection provided
these lists shall not be used for promotional, commercial or marketing purposes; however, nothing herein shall

inspection prior to the bid opening; in such instances all bid documents shall be available for public inspection
after bids have been opened and tabulated.

(b)
It is not advisable to award all such service contracts to one (1) firm; therefore, if practical, the contracts may be
awarded to the manufacturer or the franchised dealer or service agency of the brand to be served. Special
consideration will be given to reputable firms domiciled in the parish who are qualified to offer the service
required.
(c)
Excepting pre-placed emergency contracts in accordance with section 2-917, competitively bid contracts, other
