<p>(a)
Generally. In interpreting and applying the provisions of this UDC, they shall be held to be the minimum
requirements for the promotion of the public safety, health, convenience, comfort, prosperity, or general welfare.
This UDC is not intended to interfere with or abrogate or annul any servitudes, covenants, or other agreements
between parties; provided, however, that where this UDC imposes a greater restriction upon development, the
provisions of this UDC shall govern. Minimum values in this UDC are thresholds and are not intended to be
target values.
(b)
Rules of language. For the purpose of interpretation of the UDC, the following rules of language shall apply:
(1)
The specific controls the general;
(2)
In case of difference of meaning or implication between the text of the UDC and the captions for each section,
the text shall control;
(3)
The word "shall" is always mandatory; the word "may" is permissive and is at the discretion of the parish
council, the Jefferson Parish Planning Advisory Board ("PAB"), the planning director, or other decision-maker,
as the context may establish;
(4)
Words used in the present tense include the future; words in the singular include the plural; and words of one (1)
gender include all other genders, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary within the time frame subject
to extensions provided herein;

All words, terms and phrases not otherwise defined herein shall be given their usual and customary meaning,
unless the context clearly indicates a different meaning was intended.
(c)
Graphics. Illustrations are provided for the convenience of the user and in case of a conflict with the text of this

completed within the time frame subject to extensions.

Time limits. Applications submitted pursuant to this UDC may be scheduled for a public hearing before the PAB
or Old Metairie Commission (OMC), provided all information required by this UDC has been submitted, and
staff has made a determination regarding conformance with all requirements of this UDC. Except as otherwise
provided, no application shall be deemed approved due to the failure of Parish staff or officials to act within any
timelines established within this UDC. Extensions requested by the applicant or delays due to applicant's failure
to respond to requests for additional information shall not constitute failures to act by parish staff or officials.
The parish will endeavor to process all applications as expeditiously as is reasonable. Any applicable application
that does not receive approval of the parish council within one hundred twenty-six (126) days of opening of the
PAB public hearing shall be deemed denied. See Article 2 of this UDC for additional procedural guidance.

<p>The use of buildings and land within the parish shall be subject to all other applicable provisions of the Jefferson
Parish Code of Ordinances as well as this UDC, whether or not such other provisions of the Code are
specifically cross-referenced herein. Cross-references to other provisions of this Code and other applicable rules
and regulations are for the convenience of the reader; lack of a cross-reference should not be construed as an
indication that other provisions do not apply.

regulation of the parish, state or federal government contains certain standards covering the same subject matter,
the more restrictive requirements or higher standards shall govern, unless otherwise provided.

procedures for development. Other portions of this Code, as well as other standards, shall apply to development,

<h5 id="sec-33-113-enforcement">Sec. 33-1.13. - Enforcement.</h5>
<p>(a)
Violations. The remedies provided in this section for violations of any provision of this UDC, whether civil or
criminal, shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy provided by law. Except as otherwise
provided in this UDC, any development or use initiated after adoption of this UDC, or maintained in violation of
this UDC, which is not in compliance with the provisions of this UDC is prohibited and shall be punishable as
such. Any of the following shall be a violation of this UDC and shall be subject to the remedies and penalties
provided for in this UDC; including, but not limited to:
(1)
Activities inconsistent with this UDC. To engage in development or subdivision of any land in contravention of
any regulation of this UDC.
(2)
Activities without permit or approval. To engage in any subdividing, development, construction, or other activity
of any nature upon land that is subject to this UDC without all of the approvals required by this UDC.
(3)
Activities inconsistent with permit. To engage in any development, use, construction, or other activity of any
nature in any way inconsistent with the terms and conditions of any permit, approval, certificate or other form of
authorization required by this UDC to engage in such activity.
(4)
Activities inconsistent with conditions. To violate, by act or omission, any term, condition, or qualification
placed by a decision-making body upon any permit or other form of authorization granted pursuant to this UDC.
(5)
Removing or defacing required notice. To remove, deface, obscure or otherwise interfere with any notice
required by this UDC.
(b)
Separate offenses may be charged. Each day that a violation remains uncorrected shall constitute a separate
violation of this UDC, with such violations beginning ten (10) days after the property owner has been notified in
writing of such violation by the parish.
(c)
Civil remedies and enforcement powers. In case any development activity occurs in violation of this UDC, the
parish, in addition to other remedies, may institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such
unlawful development activity, to restrain, correct, or abate such violation, to prevent the occupancy of said
building, structure, or land or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business, or use in or about such premises. The
following remedies and enforcement powers may be used to administer and enforce this UDC:
(1)
Withhold permit. The parish may deny or withhold all permits, certificates, approvals, or other forms of
authorization on any land, structure, or improvements thereon upon which there is an uncorrected violation of a
provision of the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances or of a condition or qualification of a permit, certificate,
approval, or other authorization previously granted by the parish. This enforcement provision shall apply
regardless of whether the current owner or applicant is responsible for the violation in question.
(2)
Permits approved with conditions. Instead of withholding or denying a permit or other authorization, the parish
may grant such authorization subject to the condition that the violation be corrected.
(3)
Revoke permits. Any development permit or other form of authorization required under this UDC may be
revoked when the parish determines that:
a.
There is departure from the plans, specifications, or conditions as required under terms of the permit;
b.
The development permit was procured by false representation or was issued by mistake; or
c.
Any of the provisions of this UDC are being violated.
Written notice of such revocation shall be served upon the owner, the owner's agent or contractor, or upon any
person employed on the building or structure for which such permit was issued, or shall be posted in a prominent
location; and, thereafter, no such construction shall proceed.
(4)
Stop work. With or without revoking permits, the parish may stop work on any development activity on any land
on which there is an uncorrected violation of a provision of this UDC or of a permit or other form of
authorization issued hereunder.
(5)
Revoke plan or other approval. Where a violation of this UDC involves a failure to comply with approved plans
or conditions to which the approval of such plans was made subject, the parish may, upon notice to the applicant
and other known parties in interest (including any holders of building permits affected) and after a public
hearing, revoke the approval or condition its continuance on strict compliance with this UDC, the provision of
security to ensure that construction is completed in compliance with approved plans, or such other conditions as
the parish may reasonably impose.
(6)
Injunction and abatement. The parish, through its authorized agents, may initiate injunction or abatement
proceedings or other appropriate action in the district court against any person who fails to comply with any
provision of this UDC, or any requirement or condition imposed pursuant to this UDC, to prevent, enjoin, abate,
or terminate violations. The parish may seek a court order in the nature of mandamus, abatement, injunction, or
other action for proceeding to abate or remove a violation or to otherwise restore the premises in question to the
condition in which they existed prior to the violation.
(d)
Penalty.
(1)
Whoever, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within a subdivision, transfers or sells or
agrees to transfer or sell any land by reference to or exhibition of or by other use of a plat of a subdivision or a
plan for the land, before such plat or plan has been approved and recorded or filed with the Jefferson Parish
Clerk of Court, shall make the instrument of transfer subject to compliance with laws, ordinances, and
regulations relative to the development of subdivisions.
(2)
Whoever, being the owner or agent of the owner of any land located within a subdivision, transfers or sells or
agrees to transfer or sell any land by reference to or exhibition of or by other use of a plat of a subdivision or a
plan for the land, before such plat or plan has been approved and recorded or filed with the Jefferson Parish
Clerk of Court, without making the instrument of transfer subject to compliance with laws, ordinances, and
regulations relative to the development of subdivisions or land, shall be prohibited from obtaining a permit,
certificate, approval, or other form of authorization until the instrument of transfer is rectified. The description of
such lot or parcel by metes and bounds in the instrument of transfer or other document used in the process of
selling or transferring shall not exempt the transaction from such penalties or from the remedies herein provided.
The parish may enjoin such transfer or sale or agreement by suit for injunction brought in any court of
competent jurisdiction.
(e)
Notification procedures. Whenever a violation of this UDC occurs, the parish shall give written notice of such
violation either personally or by First-Class United States mail to the owner(s) of the property and the person(s)
responsible for the violation, if known. Unless otherwise provided in this Code, the letter shall direct that within
ten (10) days following the mailing or the personal receipt of the written notice, the violation shall be abated. If
after such time the violation continues, the parish may issue a citation. If the violation is abated, but occurs again
at a later date, the parish may issue citation directly without providing the owner(s) or the violator(s) any further
notice, unless otherwise provided in this Code.

<h4 id="division-1-common-procedures">DIVISION 1. - COMMON PROCEDURES</h4>
<h5 id="sec-33-21-purpose">Sec. 33-2.1. - Purpose.</h5>
<p>The purposes of this article are to consolidate the procedures for filing and processing applications for
development approval and to allow users to ascertain the steps involved in obtaining development approval—
from filing of an application, reviewing for completeness and compliance with standards and requirements, and
through holding of a public hearing if required. The provisions of this article are designed to implement the
parish's comprehensive plan.
(Ord. No. 24989 , § II, 8-12-15)</p>
<h5 id="sec-33-22-generally">Sec. 33-2.2. - Generally.</h5>
<p>Any proposed land use or development shall comply with the procedures of this UDC. Development approvals
are required for all development, unless otherwise excepted, to ensure compliance with adopted codes,
standards, and regulations, and to ensure consistency with the comprehensive plan and policies of the parish.
This division describes procedures that are common to multiple types of applications. Reference is made to the
appropriate section of this Code when procedures and requirements of a particular application are addressed
elsewhere. Generally, the procedures for all applications have five (5) common elements:
(1)
Submittal of a complete application, including required fee payment and appropriate information;
(2)
Determination of the category of development approval and review of the submittal by appropriate staff,
agencies, and boards;
(3)
A recommendation, if applicable, and a decision to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application;
(4)
If necessary, amending or appealing the decision; and
(5)
Recording the decision.

<h5 id="sec-33-23-categories-of-development-approvals">Sec. 33-2.3. - Categories of development approvals.</h5>
<p>Pursuant to this article and as described in Table 33-2.3-1, development approvals comprise three (3) basic
categories: legislative (L), quasi-judicial (Q), and ministerial (M).
(1)
A legislative development approval requires action by the parish council and includes, but is not limited to, a
UDC or zoning text amendment, rezoning, conditional use permit, or major subdivision, all of which require a
public hearing.
(2)
A quasi-judicial development approval, which requires a public hearing and entails procedural due process
requirements, involves the application of a discretionary standard required by this Code. An example is a
variance granted by the board of zoning adjustments.
(3)
A ministerial development approval involves the application of the standards of this Code by an administrative
official. A public hearing is not required, or, if required, has already been conducted and the development
approval application ensures that the proposed use complies with the previously approved plat, plan, or zoning
amendment. An example is the issuance of a building permit by the director of inspection and code enforcement.
Administrative officials include, but are not limited to, the directors of planning and inspection and code
enforcement.

<p>Unless required in this UDC for a specific application type, applicants are encouraged to meet with staff prior to
filing an application to discuss the nature of the proposed application, application submittal requirements, the
procedure for action, and the standards for evaluation of the application. At the pre-application conference, the
planning director, public works director, inspection and code enforcement director, or other administrative
director may determine that additional information is necessary to provide for an adequate assessment of the
project. At any time during the processing of any application, additional information may be required by the
decision-maker to ensure compliance with this UDC.

<p>(1)
Applications. Current application materials shall be made available in the office of the director responsible for
the development approval. Such applications shall be filed in advance of any public hearing required pursuant to
this Code. The director may establish a schedule for filing any application for development approval that may

publication consistent with state law or other applicable requirements. Completed applications shall be filed and
processed according to the schedule.
(2)
Completeness and staff review. Within three (3) days of the submittal of an application for development

the determination.
(3)
The applicable administrative department shall review applications for compliance with all applicable
regulations and with the processes described in this UDC or other applicable provisions of the Jefferson Parish

<p>(a)
Upon adoption of a resolution or introduction of an ordinance, the council may call for moratorium on
development approvals affected by the proposed amendment or adopt interim development standards. Such
moratorium or interim development standards shall be in effect from the date that a resolution is adopted or an
ordinance is placed in summary for up to one (1) year or until the effective date of the ordinance, whichever
occurs first. The council action shall not affect action on completed applications submitted prior to the resolution
or ordinance, but may affect subsequent applications for the same project. When calling a study or invoking a
moratorium, the Council may establish interim development standards providing for reasonable approval
conditions or exemptions for certain types of development applications that would otherwise be affected by the
study or moratorium. Introduction of an ordinance that conveys the substantial intent of the planning director's
findings and recommendations for the final disposition of a study shall extend a moratorium or interim zoning
regulations for an additional period not to exceed six (6) months or the effective date of final council action,
whichever comes first.
(b)
The expiration of a moratorium or interim development standards shall not result in the expiration of a study.
The planning director shall notify the council ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of a moratorium. At any
time during the ninety (90) day period the council may extend the moratorium or interim development
regulations by resolution or ordinance for no more than one (1) additional period not to exceed six (6) months.
Upon the expiration of the moratorium no identical moratorium shall be imposed for a two (2) year period from
the final expiration date of the expired moratorium.

<p>This section applies to certain uses that because of unique characteristics or potential impacts on adjacent and
nearby land uses, are not permitted as a matter of right but which may, under appropriate standards and factors,
be approved. Compliance with the generally applicable requirements may not be sufficient, and additional
measures and conditions may be necessary to mitigate the impact of the proposed development. These uses shall
be permitted through the issuance of a conditional use permit (CUP) within a site plan approved by the parish
council after ensuring that the use can be appropriately accommodated on the specific property; that it will
conform to the comprehensive plan; that it can be constructed and operated in a manner that is compatible with
the surrounding land uses and overall character of the community; and that the public interest, health, safety, and
general welfare will be promoted. For purposes of this Code, a special permitted use is the same as a conditional
use.
(1)
Applicability. The conditional use permit procedures apply only to any conditional use permit authorized in this
UDC. The provisions of this section apply to any application for approval of a conditional use enumerated by a
"C" in the applicable use matrix. Conditional uses are those uses that may be compatible with the land uses
permitted by right but that require individual review of their location, design, and configuration, and the
imposition of conditions or mitigations in order to ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location
within the zoning district.
(2)
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, agricultural, timber, natural resource exploration and
extraction, and other resource based uses are permitted and authorized in undeveloped areas of the U-1S without
the requirement of a conditional use permit until such time as those specific areas are approved for development
by the council.
(3)
Initiation. An owner of real property in unincorporated Jefferson Parish or the owner's authorized applicant may
apply for a CUP for that property by filing an application with the planning department. The application shall
include the material required for a site plan in the Appendix of the UDC and shall provide substantial competent
evidence in the form of data, reports, or impact assessments to support findings related to the suitability of the
use.
(4)
Procedure and approval. When the planning director has determined that the application is complete, she shall
forward the application to the LURTC for review and comment. After LURTC review, the planning director
shall make findings and a technical recommendation regarding approval of the CUP and submit her findings and
recommendation to the PAB and council in accordance with the procedures of subsections A, B, C, and D of
section 33-2.21.4 Decision makers of this division. Pursuant to these procedures, a CUP shall require a public
hearing. The planning director and PAB may concurrently process and review the CUP and its site plan with a
concept plan, rezoning, or subdivision application for the same property. The council shall make the final
decision regarding approval of the CUP and may concurrently take action on related applications for concept
plan, rezoning, or subdivision.
(5)
Conditions. In approving any CUP, the council may:
a.
Impose such reasonable standards, conditions, or requirements, in addition to or that supersede any standard
specified in this Code, or within federal or state regulations and standards if federal or state provisions allow

advertised for public hearing in compliance with the procedures of this UDC, an application requesting
substantially the same use on all or part of the same described land shall not be reconsidered within one (1) year
of withdrawal. No application for a CUP for any lot or parcel that requests the same use and same conditions
shall be considered within one (1) year of a final decision denying the application.
(8)
Amendments. An amendment is a request for any enlargement, expansion, increase in intensity or density,
relocation, or modification of any condition of a previously approved and currently valid CUP. Unless otherwise
provided, amendments shall be processed as follows:
a.
Minor amendment. After review and comment from LURTC the planning director may approve a shift of five
(5) percent or less, calculated cumulatively over what was approved in the initial CUP application, in the width,
length, depth, or diameter of the location of a building, structure, or impervious surface to meet a foundation or
similar study or accommodate a condition discovered during construction; or a five (5) percent or less increase
in either building footprint, gross floor area, or impervious surface calculated cumulatively over what was
approved in the initial CUP application; provided that such minor changes comply with the following criteria:

keeping with the intent of the comprehensive plan.
b.
Major amendment. Any proposed amendment other than those provided in this section for minor amendment are
considered a major amendment and shall be approved in the same manner and under the same procedures as are
applicable to the issuance of the initial development approval.
(9)
Nonconforming uses. For an existing and currently valid conditional use that is no longer allowed as a
conditional use in the zoning district in which it is located, the parish council, upon receipt of an application
forwarded by the planning director, may review and approve an amendment to said development approval,
provided that such amendment does not allow the use to be enlarged, expanded, increased in intensity, relocated,
or continued beyond any limitation specified in the existing use development approval or established in Chapter
40, zoning, Article XXXVII nonconforming uses of this Code.
(10)
Recordation. A copy of all plans, agreements, ordinances, resolutions, or other documents associated with the
authorization of a conditional use pursuant to this section shall be recorded at the expense of the applicant in the
name of the property owner in the office of the Jefferson Parish Clerk of Court, pursuant to the procedures of
section 33-2.25.4 Recordation of approved site plan of this UDC.

<h5 id="sec-33-2251-purpose">Sec. 33-2.25.1. - Purpose.</h5>
<p>Site plans are intended to provide detailed information about the location, design, and configuration of proposed
buildings, parking, access ways, landscaping, yards, and other features of site development. This information is
needed to demonstrate compliance with applicable requirements for the location and type of development and is
vital to ensure the continued health, safety, and welfare of the general public. Recognizing that administrative
staff is capable of evaluating site plans as a matter of course in the review of development permits, that the land
development regulations are specific in terms of their requirements, including which uses are subject to site plan
review and in which zoning districts site plan review shall occur, that the need for a public hearing is reduced for
most projects, and in accordance with law, the parish establishes a ministerial or staff procedure for site plan
approval and provides a ministerial/quasi-judicial procedure and a legislative procedure for site plans that
require a public hearing and action by the board of zoning adjustments or the parish council.

<p>Unless otherwise provided in this Code, site plans shall be submitted to the planning department. The planning
director shall forward the site plan to the LURTC for review and comment prior to action. Lack of findings from
LURTC within ten (10) days shall be construed as no objection to approval. After evaluating LURTC comments
and the site plan's compliance with applicable development standards, the planning director shall render a
decision: 1) the application qualifies for ministerial development approval; 2) the application qualifies for
ministerial/quasi-judicial development approval; or 3) the application is subject to legislative development
approval.
(1)
Ministerial development approval. Unless otherwise provided in this Code, the planning director shall approve
the site plan if it fully complies with the criteria and standards set forth in the applicable zoning district and other
applicable sections of this UDC or chapters of this Code, or if it does not fully comply but has been granted a
ministerial exception.
(2)
Ministerial/quasi-judicial development approval. If the standards of the zoning district or in other applicable
sections of this Code authorize the board of zoning adjustments (BZA) to grant a variance or exception for
criteria and standards and the applicant requests this quasi-judicial action, the planning director shall forward the
application with a recommendation regarding approval to the BZA and shall withhold approval of the site plan
until the BZA takes final action.
(3)
Legislative development approval. If the standards of the zoning district or in other applicable sections of this
Code authorize the parish council to approve a concept or development plan, or grant a variance, waiver, or
exception for criteria and standards and the applicant requests this legislative action, the planning director shall
forward the application with a recommendation regarding approval to the Old Metairie Commission or the
planning advisory board, as applicable, for a public hearing and recommendation and to the council for final
action.
(4)
Submittal requirements. The application for site plan review shall include the information listed in the appendix
of this UDC, unless additional information is required by the zoning district standards or other applicable
sections of this Code, or the planning director finds, in writing, that specific information is not required or
additional information is required to evaluate compliance with applicable development standards.
(5)
Effect of approval.
a.
The approved site plan, as indicated by the dated signature of the Council Chairperson or Planning Director, as
applicable, shall govern development and use of the property until a new or amended site plan is approved. Until
a site plan is approved, no building or structure shall be erected, added to, or structurally altered; no parking lot
shall be paved, added to, or structurally altered; and, no building permit or certificate of completeness shall be
issued. Any deviation from the approved site plan is a violation of this UDC.
b.
Final site plan approval shall be valid for a period of one (1) year, except that a phasing plan approved by the
Council or Planning Director, as applicable, may provide for approval of discreet project phases over a period of
up to three (3) years. Site plan approvals of longer than three (3) years may be authorized through Parish
Council approval of a development agreement as provided in Division 4, Development Agreements, in this
Article.
c.
If approval of the site plan lapses because no building permit has been issued or the building permit lapses and
has not been reactivated, then the approved site plan shall be deemed null and void.

copies of the final site plan of the project as approved by the council. After certification by the planning director
that the submitted plans conform to the approval of the council, as indicated by the dated signature of the
planning director, the planning department shall submit the original and four (4) copies of the certified site plan
to the clerk of council who shall submit the site plans to the clerk of court for recordation with the council
ordinance or resolution that approved the project, within sixty (60) calendar days of the effective date of the
ordinance, resolution, or certification by the planning director that the site plan conforms to the approval of the
council, whichever is later. After recordation, the clerk of council shall convey the original to the planning
department and two (2) copies of the recorded site plan to the department of inspection and code enforcement,
and shall file one (1) copy of the recorded site plan with the clerk of court and one (1) copy with the clerk of
council.

<p>(a)
To facilitate flexibility in design while maintaining the health, safety, and welfare of the public, the planning
director, upon consideration of LURTC comments, may grant ministerial exceptions, where specifically
authorized by the Code, where the applicant demonstrates, through documentation based on generally accepted
planning and urban design principles, that full compliance would be impracticable due to site or other physical
constraints, or that an alternative approach would achieve the purposes of the standards without posing a threat
to health and safety or degrading the general welfare.
(b)
Where the planning director does not grant a ministerial exception, the applicant may appeal the decision made
by the planning director to the parish council. Upon consideration of the written report of the planning director,
the council shall decide the appeal by adoption of a resolution and may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
may modify the decision appealed as provided in the resolution.

Does not involve more than two (2) acres of land or ten (10) lots of record.
c.
Does not result in the creation of a lot that is below the minimum width, depth, and area requirements of this
code, except when the new width, depth, or area increases conformance with the minimum width, depth, or area
requirements of this code, without creating greater deficiency in any of these requirements.
d.
Does not involve the creation of a subdivision with private street(s) as described in section 33-7.5 Transportation
of this UDC or the creation of a private or common driveway as described in section 33-6.4 Block and lot
standards (c) single-family residential lots of this UDC.
e.
Does not result in a lot of record that is designated with two (2) or more zoning districts, excluding overlay
districts.
f.
Does not result in the rear lot line of the new lot adjoining the side lot line of another lot or the side lot line of
the new lot adjoining the rear lot line of another lot, when the property to be subdivided is within or abutting a
residential zoning district, unless the following conditions are met:
1.
The adjacent lot(s) is under the same ownership as the subject lot; or
2.
The planning director receives no letter of objection after notifying abutting property owner(s) of the application
for minor subdivision. The applicant shall provide the planning department with a notarized list of the names
and addresses of the abutting property owners affected by the change in lot orientation as part of the application
for minor subdivision, and the costs of certified mail shall be borne by the applicant. Any objection, which must

Approval.
(1)
Unless specifically stated in the resolution of the parish council, approval of the concept plan shall constitute
consent to proceed with the subdivision process subject to the conditions of approval, which should address the
mix and intensity of proposed land uses, the general street layout, general drainage patterns, and the phasing of
development shown within the concept plan.
(2)
Unless specifically stated in the resolution of the parish council, the concept plan approval shall lapse two (2)
years after approval by the parish council if the applicant has not recorded a plat for the first phase of
development, or, at any time during the two (2) year period, when development lags one (1) year behind the
approved phasing plan.
(3)
Prior to lapse of approval, the applicant may file a written request with the planning director to make
adjustments to the phasing plan, which shall be reviewed by the LURTC and acted on by resolution of the parish
council. The parish council may direct the PAB to conduct a public hearing when changes to the phasing plan
will affect property owners other than the applicant.
(4)
Re-approval of a lapsed concept plan shall follow the same procedure as the initial approval of a concept plan.
(5)
Adjustments to the concept plan may be authorized concurrently with subsequent preliminary plat submittals.

Consistency with the comprehensive plan and other applicable planning documents;
(2)
Consistency with existing or proposed zoning of the property;
(3)
Existing or proposed availability of adequate facilities and services;
(4)
Suitability of the site for the proposed development;
(5)
Compatibility of development with existing and planned land use patterns;
(6)
Compatibility of the development with the neighborhood norm (as defined in this UDC);
(7)
Whether the proposed development is premature as evidenced by: the lack of adequate public facilities within a
reasonable distance to the site; or extraordinary service delivery costs due to the remote location or poor access
to the site;

Whether the traffic impacts from the proposed development can be adequately mitigated in accordance with a
traffic impact analysis, if required; and
(11)
Whether the proposed development is consistent with an applicable concept plan approval.
(d)
Approval.
(1)
Unless specifically stated in the ordinance of the parish council, approval of the preliminary plat shall constitute
consent to proceed with the subdivision process subject to the conditions of approval, which should address the
subdivision lot design, street, and right-of-way arrangement, servitudes, common areas, and other subdivision
design issues. If adequate information is available the ordinance may address on- and off-site improvement
responsibilities.
(2)
Unless specifically stated in the ordinance of the parish council or a previous action on a phasing plan, the
preliminary plat approval shall lapse one (1) year after approval by the parish council.
(3)
Prior to lapse of approval, the applicant may file a written request with the planning director for one (1)
extension to the preliminary plat for a period not to exceed one (1) year. After considering the LURTC
recommendation, the parish council may grant the request by resolution. Re-approval of a lapsed preliminary
plat shall follow the same procedure as the initial approval of the preliminary plat.
(4)
Minor amendments to the preliminary plat may be approved by the parish council at the time of action on the
final plat. Minor amendments may include any of the following changes:
a.
Changes to lot line locations that do not increase the number or change the orientation of lots and do not create
any lots or blocks that fail to conform to subdivision or zoning design standards;
b.
Adjustments in rights-of-way and servitudes that do not substantially relocate a facility, do not create any
unusable parcels, and do not create a substandard right-of-way or servitude;
c.
Reconfiguration of open space and common areas, provided that the change does not reduce the usability or area
of common open space or reduce the effectiveness of the open space in buffering adjacent property; and
d.
Changes in internal circulation patterns of local streets that do not affect external or through traffic patterns.
(5)
Major amendments to the preliminary plat shall follow the same procedure as the initial approval of the
preliminary plat.

Declare the development to be in default and require that all public improvements be installed within six (6)
months, regardless of the extent of completion of the development at the time the agreement is declared to be in
default;
(2)
Accept the applicant's vacation of the recorded plat;
(3)
Obtain funds pursuant to the surety and complete the public improvements by itself or through a third party;
(4)
Assign its right to receive funds pursuant to the surety in whole or in part to any third party, including a

exchange for the subsequent development agreement ensuring the completion of the required public
improvements; and/or
(5)
Exercise any other rights available under the law.
(j)
Release of construction surety upon completion of public improvements. Upon a satisfactory inspection of
public improvements and acceptance by the public works director, the parish council shall adopt a resolution
accepting improvements and releasing the surety in the affected subdivision plat. The surety for construction
shall not be released until the parish has accepted a warranty for maintenance of improvements. Upon written
request of the applicant, the Jefferson Parish Council Clerk shall deliver a certified copy of the resolution to the

<h5 id="sec-33-2326-process-to-record-plat">Sec. 33-2.32.6. - Process to record plat.</h5>
<p>(a)</p>
<p>Filing and recordation generally. After the parish council chairman, or in his absence, the vice-chairman, has
signed the plat and the planning director has determined that all other certifications and instruments required for
recordation are in order, the planning director shall forward a copy of the plat and related documents to the
Jefferson Parish Council Clerk for recordation within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the ordinance that
approved the concurrent preliminary and final plat or the resolution that approved the final plat.
(b)
Recordation pending sale. If a lot, parcel or tract of land for which an applicant has requested a subdivision is
the subject of a purchase agreement and the sale of the lot, parcel or tract of land is predicated on approval of the
subdivision, then the applicant shall provide written statement of such fact in the application. Within sixty (60)
days of the effective date of the ordinance that approved the concurrent preliminary and final plat, or the
resolution that approved the final plat, the applicant shall submit to the planning director a copy of the recorded
act of sale that executed the sale of the subject lot, parcel or tract of land. The planning director shall notify the
applicant in writing of the impending deadline if receipt is not timely. If the applicant fails to submit a copy of
the act of sale within sixty (60) days then the planning director shall submit an ordinance to the council that
rescinds the ordinance that approved the plat.

<h5 id="sec-33-234-abandonments">Sec. 33-2.34. - Abandonments.</h5>
<p>(a)
Purpose. When deemed to be in the public interest, and where no private rights will be injured or endangered
and neither the public nor abutting property owners will suffer significant loss or inconvenience thereby, all or a
portion of any street, alley, or public reservation, including, but not limited to, public utility or drainage
servitudes, dedicated building setback lines and access control, or subdivision plat may be vacated, in
conformance with state law. Applications for abandonment of any street, alley or a public reservation or
subdivision plat may be made by the parish or by any owner of property on which the street, alley, or public
reservation lies or adjoins.
(b)
Applicability. A street or servitude may be vacated if the street, alley, or public reservation, or servitude is not
necessary for the public safety or convenience and meets the review criteria set forth below. A plat may be
abandoned if it has not been developed or has been partially developed and the owner desires to abandon the
undeveloped portion thereof.
(c)
Application and procedure. Any street, alley, or public reservation, or portion thereof, certain public rights-ofway, or subdivision plat may be abandoned by ordinance adopted by the parish council. An application for
abandonment shall be filed with the parish attorney, who shall review and forward the application to the LURTC
for findings and recommendations. The parish attorney shall forward copies of the application to relevant
agencies not represented on the LURTC. Agency comments shall be advisory and do not constitute approval or
denial of the application. However, the parish council may address agency comments in its conditions of
approval. Following the adoption of any ordinance abandoning any street, alley, or public reservation, or portion
thereof, or subdivision plat, the parish clerk shall file a copy thereof for recording. Any abandonment of right-ofway, reservation or servitude occurring on a recorded plat shall be noted on the plat.
(d)
Reservation of servitudes. In abandoning any street, alley, or public reservation, or portion thereof, either by plat
or by ordinance, the parish council may reserve such rights-of-way and other servitudes as in the judgment of the
council are necessary or desirable for public service.
(e)
Reversion of land abandoned. Streets, alleys or other public reservations that have been abandoned shall be sold
or shall revert to the owners of adjoining properties as provided by state law and any amendments thereto.

plans and policies of the Parish;
(3)
The proposal shall not create any parcel of land without parish-approved access to public right-of-way;
(4)
The proposal shall not restrict access to any parcel so that such access is unreasonable, economically prohibitive,
or devalues any property affected by the proposed vacation;
(5)
The proposal shall have no adverse impacts on the health, safety, and/or welfare of the general community, and
shall not reduce the quality of public services provided to any parcel of land; and
(6)
There is evidence that the right-of-way, reservation, or servitude or subdivision plat is no longer needed by any
of the parties having an interest in same.
(g)
Decision-maker. The parish council shall review the application in the same manner as a plat at a public hearing
and approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application.
(Ord. No. 24989 , § II, 8-12-15)</p>
<h5 id="sec-33-235-subdivision-waivers">Sec. 33-2.35. - Subdivision waivers.</h5>
<p>(a)
Purpose. Subdivision waivers provide a mechanism for relief for property owners when strict application of this
UDC would result in practical difficulties or a particular hardship to a property owner due to unique conditions
of a property proposed to be subdivided. Waivers may be granted for lot dimensions and setbacks at the time of
preliminary plat approval. The waiver granted shall be the minimum necessary to permit reasonable use of the
land.
(b)
Applicability. Subdivision waivers to the provisions of this UDC may be requested when an applicant can
demonstrate that the unique parcel shape, size, configuration or other conditions preclude compliance with this
UDC.
(c)
Application and procedure. The application, with the required information as listed in the appendix of this UDC,
shall be filed with the planning director. Subdivision waiver requests shall be requested in writing along with a
plat application and processed concurrently with a preliminary plat application.
(d)</p>
<p>Required findings. A waiver is not a right. In conformance with State law, a waiver may be granted only upon
finding that:
(1)
The property cannot be developed reasonably under the provisions of this UDC;
(2)
The requested waiver will not conflict with the purposes of this UDC or the comprehensive plan;
(3)
The hardship does not generally apply to other properties in the parish. Reasons for hardship may relate to the
particular property, because of size, shape, topography, or other physical conditions, rather than personal
circumstances;
(4)
If the applicant complies strictly with the provisions of this UDC, then the applicant will be unable to make
reasonable use of the affected property;
(5)
The hardship does not exist because of conditions created by the owner or previous owners of the property;
(6)
Granting the requested waiver will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied by this UDC
to other lands that are similarly situated and configured;
(7)
The granting of the waiver will not be contrary to the public interest, will not adversely affect property values,
will not adversely affect other property in the vicinity, and will be in harmony with the intent and purpose of this
UDC; and
(8)
The waiver requested is the minimum modification to this UDC necessary to alleviate the hardship.
(e)
Decision maker. Decisions on subdivision waivers to this UDC shall be made by the parish council. When a
waiver to this UDC constitutes a waiver to multiple sections of this UDC, separate actions shall not be required
to modify the provisions of each section. However, each waiver shall be cited in the ordinance approving the
preliminary plat and shall be noted on the final plat.</p>

<h5 id="sec-33-241-applicability">Sec. 33-2.41. - Applicability.</h5>
<p>Except as provided below, before a subdivision plat is recorded or the department of inspection and code
enforcement issues the final certificate of compliance or completion on the building permit for a site plan
approved by the planning director or council, all applicants shall be required to complete, to the satisfaction of
the public works director, all street, sanitary, and other public improvements required by this UDC. The required
improvements shall be those specified in the approved construction plans or site plans.
(Ord. No. 24989 , § II, 8-12-15)</p>
<h5 id="sec-33-242-conditions">Sec. 33-2.42. - Conditions.</h5>
<p>If the applicant chooses not to complete all required on and off-site public improvements prior to final plat
approval or issuance of the final certificate of compliance or completion, the applicant shall provide financial
guarantees in favor of the parish to assure the construction of on- and off-site public improvements identified in
the final plat or site plan approval and documented in the development agreement. This surety shall remain in
effect for the duration of the agreement or until the parish has accepted all improvements. In the event the
applicant is unable to complete the required improvements, and such improvements are deemed necessary for
the preservation of the public health and safety, the parish may use the guarantee to complete the improvements
as required or pursue other remedies authorized by state law.

<h5 id="sec-33-243-guarantee-of-completion-of-public-improvements">Sec. 33-2.43. - Guarantee of completion of public improvements.</h5>
<p>The parish council may defer the requirement for the completion of required improvements if the applicant
enters into a development agreement by which the applicant guarantees completion of all required public
improvements no later than two (2) years following the date upon which the council approves the final plat or
the department of inspection and code enforcement issues the final certificate of compliance or completion on
the building permit for a site plan approved by the planning director or council. The parish council may
authorize an agreement providing for multi-phase development over a longer period of time, provided that the
agreement includes a phasing schedule and that provisions are made for guaranteeing completion of
improvements required to serve each phase as it is subdivided or, in the case of a site plan, developed. The
council may require the applicant to complete and/or dedicate some required public improvements, rights-ofway, or servitudes for subsequent development phases prior to approval of the final plat or issuance of the final
certificate of compliance or completion for a site plan for any phase of a multi-phase development. For public
improvements serving multiple developments the council may accept a pro rata contribution towards the funding
of required public improvements. The parish attorney's approval of the form and legality of any development
agreement is required prior to its execution. The public works director shall verify that improvement costs
provided by the applicant reasonably reflect the costs of required improvements prior to execution of the
development agreement.

<h5 id="sec-33-244-covenants-to-run-with-the-land">Sec. 33-2.44. - Covenants to run with the land.</h5>
<p>The development agreement shall provide that the covenants contained therein shall run with the land and bind
all successors, heirs, and assignees of the applicant. The development agreement shall be recorded with the
Jefferson Parish Clerk of Court in conjunction with the applicable final plat or site plan. Applicants shall be
required to have all existing lien holders subordinate their liens to the covenants contained in the development
agreement.

<h5 id="sec-33-245-performance-security">Sec. 33-2.45. - Performance security.</h5>
<p>(a)
Security required. Whenever the parish council permits an applicant to enter into a development agreement
under this section, the applicant shall be required to provide sufficient security to ensure completion of the
required public improvements. The security shall be in the form of performance bond, a trust agreement, a letter
of credit, cash escrow, or a surety bond acceptable to the parish and naming the parish as the beneficiary and
guaranteeing construction of subject improvements.
(b)
Amount of security. The performance bond, trust agreement, letter of credit, cash escrow, or surety bond shall be
in an amount estimated by the public works director as reflecting one-hundred ten (110) percent of the cost of
the improvements in the approved construction plan or site plan as calculated using prevailing wage rates, and
shall be sufficient to cover all promises and conditions contained in the development agreement.
(c)
Performance bond. In addition to all other security, when the parish participates in the cost of an improvement,
the applicant shall provide a performance bond from the contractor, with the parish as a co-obligee.
(d)
Any performance or surety bond written for a project under this Section shall be written by a surety or insurance
company currently on the U.S. Department of Treasury Financial Management Service list of approved bonding
companies which is published annually in the federal register, or by a Louisiana domiciled insurance company
with at least an A rating in the latest printing of the A.M. Best's Key Rating Guide to write individual bonds up

provisions pertaining to use regulations.</p>
<h5 id="sec-33-341-interpretation-in-general">Sec. 33-3.4.1. - Interpretation in general.</h5>
<p>The use of land, buildings, and structures is regulated in accordance with the following matrices, and subject to
the standards and regulations within this Code:
(a)
The Master Use Matrix (Table 33-3.4.4-1) lists all uses that are permitted or prohibited in any of the zoning
districts in this UDC. A function and structure code of the Land Based Classification Standards (LBCS) of the
American Planning Association (APA) corresponds to each use and shall be used to define each use (Table 333.4.1-1). The function code refers to the economic function or type of establishment. The structure code refers to
the type of structure or building. In the zoning district use matrices, the structure code is sometimes provided to
augment the function with a structural or building characteristic.
(b)
Zoning district use matrices each list all of the uses in the Master Use Matrix and identify whether each use is
permitted by-right, permitted with supplemental use regulations, permitted with the approval of a conditional use
permit, or prohibited. The zoning district use matrices are as follows:
(1)
Section 33-3.10, Residential Zoning Districts Use Matrix.

<h5 id="sec-33-342-interpretation-in-general">Sec. 33-3.4.2. - Interpretation in general.</h5>
<p>(a)
LBCS hierarchy.
(1)
No entry. The LBCS function codes establish a four-digit hierarchy of uses with digits to the right expressing
greater specificity. Where no entry appears in the zoning district columns (for example 1000, 1100 and 1110),
the uses described more specifically in the rows below (1111 and 1112 in the above example) indicate whether or
not a specific use is authorized.
(2)
Entry. Where an entry appears in the zoning district columns for a general use (for example 2520) and also for a
more specific use (for example 2521) within the same classification, the more specific code and its entry shall
govern.
(b)
Entries for permitted uses.
(1)
A "P" indicates the listed use is allowed by right within the respective zoning district.
(2)
An "S" indicates that the listed use is allowed subject to the supplemental use regulations established in the
zoning district standards, in Article 5 of this UDC, or elsewhere in the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances.
(c)
Entry for conditional uses. A "C" indicates the listed use is allowed within the respective zoning district only
after review and approval of a conditional use permit by the parish council in accordance with section 33-2.24,
Conditional use permit, of this UDC. For purposes of this UDC, a special permitted use is the same as a
conditional use. Note that supplementary conditions for some of these uses are established in Article 5 of this
UDC and within regulations for specific zoning districts.
(d)
Entry for prohibited uses. An "X" indicates the listed use is not allowed within the respective zoning district,
unless otherwise expressly allowed within this UDC. When a zoning district allows mixed-use buildings as a
specific development pattern, an "X" indicated for a private dwelling (LBCS function codes 1100) refers to
stand-alone single use dwellings with either detached or attached dwelling units. For a mixed-use building, the
number of dwelling units permitted is provided in section 33-5.20, Mixed-use buildings, of this UDC.
(Ord. No. 25411 , § 2, 8-23-17)
Editor's note— Ord. No. 25411 , § 2, adopted Aug. 23, 2017, renumbered the former §§ 33-3.4.2, 33-3.4.3 as
§§ 33-3.4.3, 33-3.4.4 and enacted a new § 33-3.4.2 as set out herein. The historical notations have been retained
with the amended provisions for reference purposes.</p>
<h5 id="sec-33-343-uses-not-specifically-listed">Sec. 33-3.4.3. - Uses not specifically listed.</h5>
<p>In the case where a use is not listed in the Master Use Matrix (Table 33-3.4.4-1), and such use is not otherwise
prohibited by law, the planning director and the inspection and code enforcement director shall determine
whether a substantially similar use exists in the Use Matrix. If the directors determine that a substantially similar
use exists, then the regulations governing that use shall apply to the particular use not listed. If the directors
determine that a substantially similar use does not exist, then the planning director shall refer to the following
documents and rules of construction to address the matter:
(1)
LBCS Tables, American Planning Association, LBCS Project, 07-Oct-09 or latest edition
(2)
North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), United States, 2007 or latest edition.
(3)
If the planning director determines that the LBCS Tables do not address the use at the appropriate level of
specificity, then she shall refer to the NAICS for guidance. If a use is listed for a general classification while a
more specific classification within the same industry classification is also listed, the specific classification shall
govern.
(4)
In referring to the NAICS, the planning director shall consider the industry description and illustrative examples
of the most specific NAICS classification that may apply to the use, and shall compare uses across similar levels
of specificity within the same NAICS classification and between NAICS and LBCS classifications.
(5)
If all nine (9) LBCS codes within a classification are populated with uses to the fourth or most specific digit,
then the planning director shall determine the most appropriate location among existing codes for a use not
specifically listed, based on the NAICS and LBCS descriptions and illustrative examples.
(6)
If LBCS has unpopulated codes within a classification and none of the listed codes are appropriate for the
unlisted use, then the planning director shall assign a new LBCS code based on the national standardization of
the NAICS and LBCS descriptions and the parish's needs for zoning and land use classification.
(7)
If the planning director determines that a new LBCS code is needed in the Master Use Matrix (Table 33-3.4.4-1),
then she shall call a text study of the use matrix in accordance with section 33-2.23 to establish a specific listing
for the use and the appropriate district or districts where such use shall be allowed.
(8)
If, when seeking periodic ratification of interpretations through text amendment to this Code, the planning
director's or inspection and code enforcement director's interpretation is reversed by action of the council, then
decisions regarding a development application made in reliance on the director's interpretation shall be valid,
except that nonconforming use regulations of this Code shall apply.

Bucktown Mixed-Use Residential (OBM-1).</p>
<h5 id="sec-33-3511-purpose">Sec. 33-3.51.1. - Purpose.</h5>
<p>The purpose of the Old Bucktown Mixed Use Residential District (OBM-1) is to provide a primarily residential
district mixed with some light commercial uses to support the needs of the neighborhood. The OBM-1 shall
serve as a transition zone between the less restrictive Old Bucktown Mixed Use Commercial District (OBM-2)
located to the north and the more restrictive single family residential districts located to the south and west,
particularly with respect to permitted uses, height, and density. The OBM-1 employs special design standards
that respect the area's relationship with Lake Pontchartrain, promote pedestrian and bicycle access and
circulation, reduce vehicular movements, encourage walkability, increase public safety, and improve the overall
quality of development with alternative innovative residential and mixed use design. In order to ensure the
residential character of the OBM-1, design standards are geared toward maximizing architectural compatibility
in the mixed use of residential and limited retail and service establishments allowed in the district and building a
safe and dynamic pedestrian environment.

<h5 id="sec-33-35361-building-design">Sec. 33-3.53.6.1. - Building design.</h5>
<p>(a)
Building design standards.
(1)
Purpose. Design standards shall be applied in Fat City in order to recognize, preserve, and protect the culture and
history of Fat City, while promoting modern design and an urban environment that looks towards the future.
(2)
Standards. Section 33-6.8, Building design, shall apply, with the following exception: Pre-engineered industrialstyle buildings devoid of scaling elements, as described in section 33-6.8.3.1(c), are prohibited in the FC-1
district.
(3)
Design basis. As Fat City developed, largely in the 1960s and 1970s, much of its architecture followed the latest
trends of the time. Building on Fat City's architectural character established by its historic stock of buildings, the
parish desires to enhance Fat City's urban environment and economic viability by creating a consistent visual
character, promoting quality design practices and materials, and encouraging a clean, contemporary architectural
style through the application of the following guidelines:
a.
Commercial architecture.</p>
<p>• Building entrance is highlighted using an extended frame.
• Storefronts are broken up using varied building height along the length of the façade.
• Large storefront windows allow for ample transparency, and are in proportion with the building's first floor
height.
• Prominent yet subtle signage is employed to announce both the complex and the individual vendors.
• Several simple materials are used to create the design, including brick, concrete, and metal panels.
b.
Residential architecture.</p>
<p>• Building entrances are highlighted using stairs that project from the façade.
• The building remains the same height across its façade, but individual units are distinguished by changing
planes and with the use of protruding clearstory canopies.
• Transparency is given priority, though additional shade and screening devices would likely be utilized in our
hot southern climate.
• Both trees and low plantings help to provide a human scale to the streetscape, breaking up the long façade.
• Simple, clean details are created using a palette of basic materials: masonry, glass, metal panels, and concrete.
c.
Civic architecture.</p>
<p>• An open corner creates a welcoming presence, while the entrance is provided with shade and weather
protection.
• The building remains the same height across its façade, but clearstory windows provide a separation from the
façade, which creates visual interest.
• Trees are provided, though additional landscaping would allow the building to better relate to the scale of
pedestrians.
• Simple, clean details are created using a palette of basic materials: masonry, glass, metal panels, and concrete.
(b)
Entrances. Non-residential or mixed-use buildings must have a customer entrance door facing each abutting
street. For buildings facing two (2) streets, a corner entrance door is allowed.
(c)
Garage doors for outdoor seating. A use with outdoor seating may utilize a garage door in relation to the outdoor
seating if a minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of the garage door is transparent.
(d)
Mural. Murals are allowed on building walls and masonry fences or enclosures. A mural:
(1)
Shall not:
a.
Extend more than six (6) inches from the surface on which it is applied;
b.
Extend beyond the height of the structure on which it is applied;
c.
Obscure required openings; and
d.
Include moving or protruding elements.
(2)</p>
<p>May feature the name of the artist(s) of the mural and date of completion in the form of a plaque or notation not
to exceed the lesser of five (5) percent of the mural area or six (6) square feet. The plaque or notation bearing the
name of the artist(s) must be located in a lower corner of the mural area.
(3)
Must be applied in a durable material or paint finish that can withstand at least five (5) years of regular wear and
weathering.
(4)
May be externally illuminated, but may not include internally illuminated elements.

private property in a dedicated servitude, in accordance with the dimensions provided in Table 33-3.53.6.2-1.
For purposes of this section, streets not listed in Table 33-3.53.6.2-1 shall comply with the standards for

additional criteria are met:
a.
The variance is consistent with the general provisions and intent of the zoning district;

<h5 id="sec-33-3539-parking-mitigation">Sec. 33-3.53.9. - Parking mitigation.</h5>
<p>(a)
Purpose. The parish finds that adequate parking is important for the economic success of Fat City. Many
properties in Fat City will be unable to accommodate required parking due to their smaller lot size. Dispersing
parking off-site in a way that serves multiple properties provides a more efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable
way to serve Fat City's parking needs. The parish finds that, at the time of new development, redevelopment, or
change of use requiring site plan approval, a proportionate capital contribution to construct additional public
parking is a fair and equitable method of apportioning the cost of such additional parking among all property
within the Fat City districts without unreasonably burdening vacant lands or existing development that is not
undergoing new development, redevelopment, or change of use. Accordingly, this section allows property
owners to substitute payments toward off-site parking for required on-site parking.
(b)
Maximum mitigation. The amount of required parking that may be mitigated through this section shall not
exceed:
(1)
Seventy (70) percent for retail, restaurant, or office uses;
(2)
Ten (10) percent for lodging uses; or
(3)
Fifty (50) percent for all other uses.
(c)
Amount. Pro rata contributions shall be based on the capital costs of providing parking spaces in parking
structures. The per-stall fee shall be eighteen thousand four hundred dollars ($18,400.00) in 2010 dollars and
shall be adjusted annually in November of each year based on the "Engineering News Record" Construction
Cost Index 20-City average (ENR CCI) for November. The actual fee-in-lieu amount shall be established at the
time of payment and approved by the parish attorney.
(d)
Payment. No certificate of completion shall be issued until complete payment has been received by the parish or
the parish council has:
(1)
Approved an agreement providing for a phased payment plan. In no case shall payments be deferred for more
than two (2) years;
(2)
Approved an agreement providing for the deferred construction or occupancy of floor space for which parking
has not been mitigated; or
(3)
Approved other arrangements providing for required parking to serve the proposed use within twelve (12)
months of the application. In no case shall arrangements include a parking variance.
(e)
Parking mitigation fund.
(1)
All proposed parking mitigation contributions shall be approved by the parish attorney, and the parish shall
deposit and hold all contributions, together with interest thereon, in a parking mitigation fund hereby created,
and said funds shall be expended only for the purpose of creating new public parking serving the Fat City
districts.
(2)
The cost of creating new public parking shall include all costs related to land acquisition, design, permitting,
drainage, mitigation, and construction of lighted and paved public parking, including engineering, legal,
consulting, and internal overhead costs.
(3)
The moneys in the parking fund may be allowed to accumulate from year to year until the parish council
determines to expend the moneys in the fund for the purposes specified.
(4)
The moneys shall be expended in all cases within five (5) years of collection. Any contribution not expended
shall be refunded to the property owner of record at the time of the refund.
(f)
Credits. The imposition or payment of any such payments does not bar the subsequent imposition of any special
assessment upon the new development, redevelopment, or change of use of any premises for which such fees
have been previously imposed or paid. However, any special assessment for similar or like purposes takes into
consideration such prior imposition and payment and provides the then current owner of the premises with an
equitable credit for the fee actually paid for such similar or like purposes.

<p>The Avondale Industrial Marine (AIM) District is an overlay district intended to recognize and protect the
historically productive industrial site commonly known as the "Avondale Shipyard."
The AIM District promotes the redevelopment of the site as a strongly performing, value-added logistics hub
that encompasses production, distribution and repair and takes advantage of the existing multi-modal
transportation infrastructure that provides direct access to port, rail, and roadway systems. The Avondale site is
suitable for the AIM district by having the following characteristics:
•
At least seventy-five (75) percent of the land area in the district was zoned and improved for industrial uses at
least twenty-five (25) years ago. For this purpose, improved shall mean developed with buildings or other
structures, paving, or storage for industrial uses;
•
It is at least two hundred (200) contiguous acres, has a minimum frontage on the Mississippi River of one (1)
mile, and contains or is within three hundred (300) feet of an active rail line measured from the property line of
the site.
The AIM district has the following purposes:
(1)
Protect and promote active or prime industrial land along the Mississippi River to take advantage of port and rail
facilities and services that represent indispensable nodes in the global economic network;
(2)
Provide industrial businesses greater ease and more certainty in their ability to remain and prosper in their
current locations;
(3)
Facilitate a wide variety of production uses and activities and promote integrated, value-added logistics hubs;
(4)
Promote strong distribution and repair infrastructure with efficient freight and warehousing networks;
(5)
Facilitate modern and state-of-the-art processes, controls, buildings, and equipment for production, distribution,
and repair that minimize nuisance complaints and keep impacts on adjacent and nearby areas to a minimum;
(6)
Discourage an inappropriate level of non-industrial uses and encourage appropriate commercial activity that
could improve employment opportunities and the physical condition of the district without conflicting with
production, distribution, and repair activities;
(7)
Improve employment diversity, the quality of jobs, and wages in Jefferson Parish;
(8)
Promote orderly development to efficiently bring regional assets back into commerce; and
(9)
Promote the health, safety, and general welfare of residents and businesses.

<p>The regulations of this article shall supplement the requirements of the zoning district, overlay, if applicable, and
other standards of this Code. They are in addition to, and do not replace, other development standards unless
otherwise provided. To the extent that a conflict exists between a standard in another article of the UDC or Code
and a standard in this article, the standard of this article shall govern unless otherwise indicated. No conditional
use or use subject to supplemental conditions may be initiated, established, or maintained unless it complies with
the standards set forth for such use in this article. In some cases, these standards apply to uses allowed by right
in the zoning districts subject to the supplemental standards, as indicated by an "S" in the applicable use table. In
other cases, the supplemental regulations address the unique challenges of certain uses and structures or the
distinct pattern of certain development whether permitted as a conditional use, as indicated by a "C" in the
applicable use table, or allowed by right in the supplemental use regulations of the zoning district or overlay.

Amortization of short-term rentals.
1.
Findings. The parish council finds that:
i.
Generally, Jefferson Parish is characterized by a suburban development pattern of homogenous land uses
concentrated in neighborhoods and along transportation corridors.
ii.
Where appropriate, mixed land uses are allowed to promote a denser, urban development pattern.
iii.
The most prevalent land use in Jefferson Parish is the detached single-family home, which comprises many
quiet, well-maintained, and family-oriented neighborhoods.
iv.
The short-term rental of a home is a business that generally is not compatible with the homogenous residential
character of many of Jefferson Parish's neighborhoods.
v.
Subject to use standards, the short-term rental of a home is compatible in mixed-use and commercial areas
where residential and nonresidential uses co-exist.
vi.
To promote health, safety, and the general welfare, and in accordance with the comprehensive plan, the
amortization of existing short-term rentals, within a reasonable timeframe, is necessary so these activities either
cease operations where prohibited or come into compliance where allowed by the provisions of this Code.
2.
Purpose.The purposes of this section are to:
i.
Provide an adequate timeframe for operators of permitted short-term rentals to come into compliance with the
standards and approval and licensing requirements provided for in this Code; and
ii.
Establish a fair and equitable process for the elimination of short-term rentals existing prior to the adoption date
of [the ordinance from which this section derives] and prohibited by new regulations.
3.
Amortization. Any short-term rental operating prior to [date of adoption of ordinance] shall have either twelve
(12) months to cease operations or six (6) months from said date to come into compliance with one of the
following, as applicable:
i.
If located in a zoning district where short-term rental is prohibited, shall cease operations. During the twelve
(12)-month period, the short-term rental shall be considered a nonconforming use and shall not be required to
adhere to the standards set forth in section 33-5.3.9.5.G. However, upon termination of the amortization period,
the short-term rental shall cease operation immediately.
ii.
If located in a zoning district where short-term rental is permitted, the short-term rental shall have six (6)
months, to come into compliance with the standards set forth in section 33-5.3.9.5.G. including all required
licenses.
d.
Long-term rental. Nothing in these short-term rental provisions is intended to apply to or prohibit the long term
rental of a dwelling unit for thirty (30) or more consecutive days and where typically the method of rental
involves an extended period of time and tenant obligations such as payment of utility bills in the name of the
tenant.

<p>(a)
Generally. A site plan is required in accordance with section 33-2.26 Site Plan in Article 2 of this UDC.
(1)
Administrative development approval shall apply if the planning director determines that the standards of this
section and the applicable zoning district are fully met.
(2)
Legislative approval shall apply if the planning director determines that the standards are not fully met and the
applicant requests a variance as authorized in this section.
(b)
Submittal requirements.
(1)
The applicant shall submit an application for site plan review in accordance with section 33-2.26 Site plan in
Article 2 of this UDC.
(2)
Before submittal of the application for site plan review, a pre-application conference is required in accordance
with section 33-2.4 Pre-application conferences in Article 2 of this UDC.
(3)
At the time of application, the applicant may request phasing of the development. An application that includes
phasing shall require legislative approval and a development agreement in accordance with Division 4.
Development Agreements in Article 2 of this UDC. The parish council may authorize an agreement providing
for multi-phase development over a longer period of time, provided that the development complies with the
requirements of this UDC and the following criteria:
a.
Necessary off-site improvements shall be completed first;
b.
Each phase can function and can be utilized independently of subsequent phases;
c.
At the time of application, the applicant submits a phasing schedule containing:
1.
The number of phases in which the development will be built;
2.
The dates when construction of each phase will begin and be completed. The beginning or initiation of
construction of a development shall be the date on which a building permit is issued for the development or
phase of the development and the completion of a development shall be the date on which a certificate of
occupancy or completion is issued for the development or phase of a development; and
3.
The infrastructure and on-site improvements to be included in each phase.
d.
If no phasing schedule is provided at the time of the application, the applicant shall complete the development as
a single phase including all on-site improvements as required by this Code and as delineated in the site plan
submittal.
(c)
Time limitations.
(1)
Multiphase development. The applicant shall apply for and receive a building permit for at least one (1) phase of
a multiple-phase development within one (1) year of site plan approval. The applicant shall have a maximum of
five (5) years from the date the building permit is issued to complete all phases of the development unless the
parish council or planning director approves an extension for the development.
(2)
Single phase development. The applicant shall apply for and receive a building permit within one (1) year of site
plan approval. The applicant shall have a maximum of two (2) years from the date the building permit is issued
to complete the development unless the parish council or planning director approves an extension for the
development.
(3)
Failure to meet time limitations. Approval shall be vacated and site plan approval shall become null and void if a
building permit has not been issued for single phase and multiphase development within the time limits
prescribed above, including any extension(s), and no request for extension is pending. No building permits shall
be issued for site plans that have been declared null and void. Nevertheless, such site plans may be submitted as
a new application for review, and must conform to all site plan and review requirements in effect at the time of
the later application.
(d)
Extensions.
(1)
Standards for extension. Upon a finding that unforeseen circumstances prevented completion within the
approved time limitation, the planning director may grant an extension for a period not to exceed six (6) months.
If the planning director denies a request for an extension, the applicant may appeal the decision to the parish
council. The parish council may grant extensions for periods greater than six (6) months subject to the following
provisions:
a.
Single phase development. An extension for a single phase development may be granted by council resolution
and shall not exceed a period of three (3) years.
b.
Multiphase development. An extension for a multiphase development shall be granted by ordinance, as an
amendment to the development agreement, for a period at the discretion of the council. If the council approves
an extension the applicant shall submit a revised phasing schedule to the planning department for approval by
the planning director.
(2)
Requests for extension. The applicant shall request an extension for the beginning of construction or completion
of construction. The request, including information which explains the need for the extension, shall be made in
writing to the planning director and must be received by the planning department within the original term to
complete the development. Requests that require council action shall be processed in accordance with the
procedures in Article XLVIII Changes and Amendments of Chapter 40 Zoning of this Code. The
recommendations to the parish council for extension shall be based on a finding from the planning department
and the planning advisory board that unforeseen circumstances prevented completion within the approved time
limitation.

(1)
Generally. For interior lots, the lot line common to the street right-of-way line shall be the front line. All lots
shall be arranged so that the rear line does not abut the side of an adjacent lot.
(2)
Corner lots. The lot frontage having the shortest distance shall be the front line for setback purposes, and shall
bear the official municipal address in accordance with provisions for survey and street address in Chapter 8 of
this Code.
(3)
Through lots. Both lot frontages shall be front lines for setback purposes. The Department of Inspection and
Code Enforcement shall determine which frontage must bear the official municipal address, and the address shall

<p>(a)
Buildings shall be compatible with the environment and exhibit the ability to provide protection from rain, sun,
and high humidity.</p>
<p>In the picture to the left, a cantilevered roof is extended to protect the glass curtainwall from sun and weather,
and the entrance is highlighted and protected from weather by a cantilevered portico. In the picture to the right,
recessed ground floor entryways provide shelter from sun and weather, and a thickened façade allows for
balconies but also protects glass walls from exposure.
(b)
Buildings shall maintain traditional architectural proportions. This may include, for example, smaller columns
placed closer together for more vertical applications or the supports/columns having additional mass for
horizontal applications. For clean, contemporary architecture, buildings must respond to human-scaled elements
and elements specific to their context and our local environment.</p>
<p>In the picture to the left, the building utilizes contemporary design but does not give prominence to its first floor
and therefore appears top-heavy, and it does not highlight entryways nor provide protection from the elements.
In the picture to the right, the building's windows are not scaled properly to its overall size and window sizes are
not suited to the building's commercial use.
(c)
Unless otherwise prohibited, pre-engineered industrial-style buildings devoid of scaling elements are allowed as
long as they conform to all other standards and regulations.</p>
<p>The picture to the left is an example of a pre-engineered industrial-style building devoid of scaling elements.
The picture to the right is an example of the same style of building but with scaling elements.
(d)
Multiple structures or buildings located on one property shall employ a consistent design vocabulary and use a
unifying element such as material, color, or form.</p>
<p>In the picture to the left the multi-tenant building uses multiple architectural styles that do not employ a
consistent design vocabulary. In the picture to the right, several buildings on the same lot use consistent design
elements including materials and architectural details.

<h5 id="sec-33-6832-facades">Sec. 33-6.8.3.2. - Façades.</h5>
<p>(a)
All façades of buildings visible from the street shall maintain the same standard of design as the front façade.
This shall include the continued use of similar materials and architectural details.</p>
<p>This picture shows an example of a building that uses the same standard of design on the side of the building,
which is visible from the street, as on the front of the building.
(b)
Horizontal planes shall be disrupted at least every twenty-five (25) feet of uninterrupted plane. The disruption
may be accomplished by a change in plane, material, or opening, or a more significant design element such as a
tower or gable, or other vertical elements.</p>
<p>This diagram illustrates the disruption of horizontal planes at least every twenty-five (25) feet through the use of
a change in plane and the use of a tower.

<h5 id="sec-33-6252-generally">Sec. 33-6.25.2. - Generally.</h5>
<p>(a)
Interpretation of terms. Where necessary to interpret the precise meaning of terms used in this division, the
following rules shall apply:
(1)
For technical landscaping terms, the latest edition of American Standard for Nursery Stock, which is
incorporated by reference, shall apply.
(2)
For terms referencing use or development, the following categories shall apply:
a.
Residential uses or development shall mean land, buildings, or structures devoted primarily to residential use,
including LBCS function codes 1100 and 1200. Residential districts shall mean: Suburban S-1, Single-family
residential R-1A, Suburban Residential R-1B, Rural Residential R-1C, Rural Residential R-1D, Manufacture
Home R-1MH, Two-family Residential R-2, Three- and Four-family Residential RR-3, Townhouses R-1TH, and
Multiple-family Residential R-3;
b.
Institutional uses or development shall mean land, buildings, or structures devoted primarily to institutional uses,
including LBCS function code 6000;
c.
Commercial uses or development shall mean land, buildings, or structures devoted primarily to commercial use,
including LBCS function codes 1300, 2000, 4170, 4200, and 5000; and
d.
Industrial uses or development shall mean land, buildings, or structures devoted primarily to industrial use,
including LBCS function code 3000; 4000, excluding 4170, 4200, and 4300 except public infrastructure or
utility services such as electric power, natural gas, water supply, and sewage removal; 7000; 8000; and 9000,
except for noncommercial agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting.
(b)
Expansion. When a development site or parking lot is enlarged, the requirements of section 33-6.25,
Landscaping, buffering, and screening, shall apply on an incremental basis, which means that a landscaping and
buffering requirement is applied to the enlargement, or in the case where a requirement is calculated as a
percentage of the overall site, is applied in the same proportion that the enlarged site or lot area has to the
existing development.
(c)
Appendix. The List of Approved Plant Materials, classes of trees, and other specifications for landscaping and
buffering shall apply and is included in the Landscape and Buffer Planting and Maintenance Specifications in
the Appendix of this UDC, which is available by hard or electronic copy from the planning department.
(Ord. No. 25405 , § 35, 8-9-17)</p>
<h5 id="sec-33-6253-character">Sec. 33-6.25.3. - Character.</h5>
<p>(a)
Purpose. These requirements are intended to promote the overall character of the parish and the specific
character of a corridor, district, or neighborhood. As Jefferson Parish strategically guides development and
redevelopment, it recognizes that traditional and suburban patterns reflect the established or desired character of
its built environment, and that these patterns have distinct characteristics that affect greenspace. To promote siteappropriate landscaping and the proper location, selection, installation, and maintenance of plant materials, the
standards of this division are organized by development character where appropriate.
(b)
Interpretation. Table 33-6.25.4-1, Base and Overlay Zoning Districts Requiring Greenspace Areas, distinguishes
the base and overlay zoning districts that require landscaping by two (2) development patterns: Traditional or
suburban character.
(1)
A "T" indicates traditional character: Mixed uses, narrow streets, and shallow setbacks that promote pedestrian
activity, street-level shopping, and on-street, structured, or rear- or side-facing parking that is behind the front
building line. Where a district is marked as "T," traditional standards apply.
(2)
An "S" indicates suburban character: Homogeneous uses, wide streets, and deep setbacks that emphasize
vehicular activity, shopping malls and strip centers, and off-street, surface, or front-facing parking that is streetside of the front building line. Where a district is marked as "S," suburban standards apply.
(3)
A "T/S" indicates mixed traditional and suburban character. Where a district is marked as "T/S," either
traditional character is required or suburban character is allowed, depending on the development type.
(4)
Where uncertainty exists regarding the established or desired character, the planning director shall determine the
appropriate standard based on the development type or pattern, existing or future land use, or other site or
neighborhood conditions.
(5)
Nothing in this division prevents the use of traditional standards where a district does not require traditional
character. Traditional and suburban are relative terms. A corridor, district, or neighborhood may exhibit elements
of both characters.

<h5 id="sec-33-6255-greenspace-standards">Sec. 33-6.25.5. - Greenspace standards.</h5>
<p>(a)
Generally.
(1)
Greenspace areas include streetscape, property buffers, parking lots, screening, and signs, as shown in Figure 336.25.5-1, Landscape Areas. Greenspace also encompasses significant trees preserved as a component of green
areas or the tree canopy of a corridor or neighborhood, in accordance with section 33-6.27, Tree preservation, of
this division.
(2)
The amounts of plant materials required by this section are minimum amounts. More than the minimum amount
of any plant material may be approved, as long as overcrowding at maturity will not occur and jeopardize the
health and longevity of required landscaping.
Figure 33-6.25.5-1. Landscape Areas</p>
<p>(b)
Streetscape. Streetscape landscaping is located along street rights-of-way and intended to enhance the
streetscape, define entrances and walkways, provide visual breaks along blank building facades, and screen
mechanical equipment and similar appurtenances.
(1)
Plant materials. Each streetscape landscape area shall be planted with trees, shrubs, and grass or other
groundcover in accordance with the following requirements:
a.
Trees.
1.
Traditional (T) character: One (1) Class A tree per every thirty (30) linear feet, or fraction thereof, of street
frontage is required, except that the parish landscape architect may approve multiple Class B or Class C trees as
substitute if the depth of the streetscape landscape area will not accommodate one (1) or more Class A trees.
2.
Suburban (S) character: One (1) Class A tree per every fifty (50) linear feet, or fraction thereof, of street frontage
is required.
b.
Shrubs. One (1) shrub per every three (3) linear feet of street frontage is required, except that perennials may
substitute for no more than fifty (50) percent of the required shrubs.
(2)
Planting area. The width or depth of the area planted with streetscape landscaping shall be in accordance with
the dimensional, setback, or area standards established in the applicable base or overlay zoning district.
(3)
Retaining walls. Where a retaining wall is required in accordance with section 8-3-111, Lot grade rules and
regulations, of this Code, or where a retaining wall is provided, a hedge is required along the base of the wall on
any street-facing side. Where a hedge is not practical due to site constraints, the street-facing surface of the
retaining wall shall be finished with stucco, masonry, stone, or similar decorative material that enhances the
plain concrete or plain concrete block.
(4)
Use of right-of-way. Streetscape landscaping may be located in the public right-of-way if approved by the public
works director. Use of public right-of-way to meet required streetscape landscaping shall be in accordance with
applicable district standards and section 29-6, Right-of-way obstruction, of this Code, and may require a parish
lease of right-of-way. State-owned rights-of-way may not be used to meet the streetscape landscaping
requirements of this section.
(c)
Property Buffer. Property buffers are continuous strips of landscape area located along side or rear lot lines and
intended to provide separation and screening of adjacent land uses where appropriate.
(1)
Applicability and types. There are four (4) types of property buffers based on district character, use, and adjacent
uses or districts. Table 33-6.25.5-2, Property Buffer Requirements by Use, establishes property buffers required
for each use or zoning district, by character if applicable. The "adjacent use or zoning district" is not required to
provide the buffer. Where the adjacent lot or development site contains a mixed use or is mapped with more than
one (1) zoning district, the buffer requirement associated with the most intense adjacent use or district shall
apply.
(2)
Table 33-6.25.5-3, Property Requirements by Type establishes the minimum depth, number of trees and shrubs,
and fencing required for each type of buffer.
(3)
Prohibited uses. No active recreation area, storage of materials, impervious surface, vehicular use area including
parking areas, or structures, except for necessary utility boxes and equipment, shall be located within the buffer
area. The property buffer may be included in the required building setback.
(4)
Fences. Fences required as part of a property buffer shall comply with the requirements of section 33-6.12,
Fences and walls, in Division 2, Design standards, of this article. No fence or wall is required if an existing
fence or wall provided on an abutting property meets the requirements, as determined by the planning director.

the display of motor vehicles for sale as part of an automobile or vehicle dealership.
Figure 33-6.25.5-2. Parking Lot Landscape Areas</p>
<p>(1)
Perimeter. The following landscaping is required in continuous areas along the perimeter of parking lots and
other vehicular use areas:
a.
Street rights-of-way. In accordance with the streetscape requirements of this section, shrubs that form a living
fence at maturity shall be planted along the street-facing perimeter of a parking lot or drive aisle to screen
vehicles from view of the street right-of-way.
b.
Vehicular use areas. Where vehicular use areas on different development sites abut, a minimum five-foot
continuous buffer with one (1) Class A tree per every thirty-five (35) linear feet, or portion thereof, plus a living
fence, grass, or other groundcover, shall be provided between the abutting vehicular use areas.
(2)
Interior.
a.
For traditional (T) character, parking lots are generally situated away from street rights-of-way and complement
walkability. To facilitate traditional site design, the planning director may not require some or all of the interior
lot landscape areas, depending on the size and functionality of the parking lot.
b.
No interior landscape areas are required for parking lots consisting of less than ten (10) parking spaces.
c.
Parking lots consisting of ten (10) or more parking spaces shall provide interior landscape areas in accordance
with the following requirements:
1.
A minimum of one (1) island or peninsula is required for every ten (10) contiguous parking spaces or fraction
thereof;

Interior lot landscaping shall be a minimum of ten (10) percent of site area not dedicated to required property
buffers, streetscape landscaping, or buildings.
d.
On any building side facing the interior of a parking lot, except those sides with pedestrian access to the
building, openings for windows or overhead loading-area doors, or motor vehicle bays, shall be planted with
landscaping that provides visual breaks along the blank building facade. The landscaping shall abut the building
and be comprised of trees, shrubs, or ornamental plants in any combination, provided that at least fifty (50)
percent of the total required plant materials is shrubs.
(e)
Screening.
(1)
Off-street loading spaces, refuse and outdoor storage areas, antennas, satellite dishes, and mechanical equipment
within a street-facing yard shall be screened from view from the street right-of-way;
(2)
Unless otherwise provided in this Code, the screening shall be a minimum of seven (7) feet in height or a height
sufficient to obscure the area or equipment requiring the screening, whichever is less;
(3)
Except as required in section 16-4, Solid waste storage, [subsection] (d), Bulk waste containers, in Chapter 16,

<p>(a)
General standards.
(1)
All landscaping shall be installed in a sound manner and in accordance with accepted standards of the Louisiana
Nurseryman's Manual for the Environmental Horticulture Industry, latest edition, which is incorporated herein
by reference.
(2)
Where the base or overlay district requires tree preservation, all existing trees to be preserved shall be protected
during construction in accordance with section 33-6.27, Tree preservation, of this division.
(3)
Plant material shall be true to name, variety, and size and conform to all applicable provisions of the American
Standard for Nursery Stock, latest edition.
(4)
Where palm trees are allowed, they shall be only cold hardy species acclimated to growing in south Louisiana
and are subject to the following additional standards:
a.
All palms must have a minimum trunk height of twelve (12) feet at installation, measured from the ground line
at the top of the root ball to the base of the heart leaf;
b.
Every two (2) approved palm trees shall equal one (1) tree credit and no credit will be given for Queen Palm or
other species of Zone 10 palms.
(5)
Existing preserved, protected and healthy trees may be credited towards the landscape requirements of this
section in accordance with subsection (e), Credit, below.
(6)
Each tree shall have a minimum planting area of one hundred (100) square feet and shall be planted at least
thirty (30) inches from the edge of any paved surface.
(7)
Where a living fence or hedge row is planted in a setback that is between five (5) feet and seven (7) feet, each
parking space abutting the hedge row shall include a wheel stop. The center of each shrub shall be planted at
least three (3) feet from the curb or edge of pavement.
(8)
The groundcover required in each landscape area shall form a solid mat or cover the ground within two (2) years
of installation. Where grass is provided as groundcover, sod is required.
(9)
Mulch, a minimum depth of three (3) inches, shall be provided within the root zone of trees and shrubs at the
time of planting. Mulch must be kept from direct contact with tree trunks and shrub stems. The use of cypress
mulch and impervious weed barriers is prohibited.
(b)
Class.
(1)
Class B and Class C trees may be used only to meet landscaping requirements where the planning director
determines that special site conditions do not support planting of Class A trees.
(2)
Where the applicant has the option of Class A, Class B, or Class C trees to meet a requirement, a minimum of
fifty (50) percent of the site's required trees shall be Class A trees.
(3)
Where Class B or Class C trees are used in place of Class A trees or existing trees are used to meet the
requirements of this section in accordance with subsection (e), Credit, below, the ratios in Table 33-6.25.6-1,
Tree Ratio by Class, shall apply.

Species.
(1)
The List of Approved Plant Materials (list) is established and defines the species of trees and shrubs that are
allowed to satisfy the landscape and buffer requirements of this section.
(2)
As reflected in the list, all required landscaping shall be comprised of plant materials that are indigenous or
acclimated to the growing conditions and climate of South Louisiana.
(3)
New horticultural varieties, cultivars, and species are introduced continuously into the nursery industry, and trees
not included in the list may exist in a neighborhood and provide significant tree canopy as well as contribute to
neighborhood character. Jefferson Parish encourages consideration of alternate cultivars and species to promote
diversity in its urban forest, match existing tree canopy, or maintain neighborhood character. For these purposes,
the planning director may make exceptions to the list.
(4)
Any plant material that is listed as prohibited on the list and is proposed to remain or be planted on the site shall
not count toward meeting the landscaping requirement. Artificial plant materials and invasive exotic species
shall not be used to satisfy the requirements of this section.
(d)
Diversity. Design objectives should be balanced with the need for biological and species diversity. Disease and
pest problems that potentially devastate a species make the planting of monocultures undesirable. The following
species diversity requirements shall apply based on the number of trees required for the site:
(1)
Development with less than six (6) required trees: No diversity requirement;
(2)
Development with between six (6) and forty (40) required trees: No single species shall comprise more than
thirty-five (35) percent of the total number of trees required;
(3)
Development with more than forty (40) required trees: No single species shall comprise more than twenty (20)
percent of the total number of trees required.
(e)
Credit. In order to encourage the preservation of existing healthy trees, the applicant may receive credit for an
existing healthy tree that is preserved and protected, in accordance with the ratios utilized to calculate credit in
Table 33-6.25.6-1.
(1)
Tree credit standard. Existing preserved, protected, and healthy trees may be credited towards the landscape
requirements of this section in accordance with Table 33-6.25.6-2, Tree Credit Standard. Trees on the prohibited
list and exotic invasive species will receive no credit.

the preservation of existing trees within "property buffer", "streetscape", and "parking lot" landscape areas and
other areas of the site left undisturbed by construction.
(3)
Trees preserved in each landscape area shall be credited towards the tree planting requirements of the
corresponding landscape area.
(4)
As determined by the planning director, existing or natural vegetation may be used to meet the requirements for
a landscape planting area if it provides equivalent planting units, or in the case of a buffer, provides complete
screening from the abutting property.
(f)
Size and spacing.
(1)
When they are installed, required plant materials shall comply with the minimum size requirements of Table 336.25.6-3, Minimum Size and Spacing at Time of Installation.

<h5 id="sec-33-626-low-impact-development">Sec. 33-6.26. - Low impact development.</h5>
<p>(a)
Purpose. Jefferson Parish promotes the general welfare through sustainable, low impact development which
reduces the long-term capital and operational costs of public facilities and minimizes adverse effects on the
environment, public works infrastructure, and public health. Managing stormwater with low impact development
(LID) techniques provides an approach to development and redevelopment that works with nature and can
achieve the following benefits and purposes:
(1)
Reduce flooding, runoff, subsidence, stormwater runoff volume, peak discharge rates, sewer overflows, and the
costs of stormwater and sewer treatment;
(2)
Mimic a site's predevelopment hydrology by infiltrating, filtering, storing, evaporating, and detaining
stormwater runoff;
(3)
Add green space by preserving and re-creating natural landscape features including existing tree vegetation;
(4)
Use plants and soil to absorb, slow, filter, and cleanse runoff near the source;
(5)
Promote low maintenance landscaping that reduces the use of herbicides, fertilizers, and pesticides;
(6)
Minimize imperviousness to create functional and appealing site drainage;
(7)
Treat stormwater as a resource rather than a waste product and help meet National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) requirements;
(8)
Reduce the heat island effect and mitigate the effects of development and the built environment;
(9)
Protect natural drainage features and emulate the functions of natural systems to increase recharge and
reintegrate rainfall into the water cycle and watershed; and
(10)
Reduce energy and water use.
(b)
Applicability. The applicant for any site plan review required in Chapter 33 or Chapter 40 of this Code may use
LID best management practices (BMPs) to meet or exceed the requirements for stormwater management in
Article 7 of this UDC and for landscaping, buffering, screening, and tree preservation requirements of this Code.
(c)
Best management practices (BMPs). An application for low impact development shall demonstrate the use of
BMPs, including, but not limited to, the techniques described in "Bayou Land RC&amp;D Stormwater BMP
Guidance Tool," to meet stormwater management requirements. Jefferson Parish recognizes that in most cases,
BMPs, or nonstructural practices, will need to be combined with engineered or structural approaches to meet
requirements. BMPs may be placed in the public right-of-way upon approval of the parish engineering director,
provided that the perpetual maintenance of the BMPs is borne exclusively by the property owner.
(d)
Standards. An application for low impact development shall, in addition to all other applicable requirements,
achieve the following standards, as applicable: for new developments, retain and filter the first one and onequarter (1.25) inch rainfall event through the utilization of BMPs; or, for redevelopment, either filter the first one
and one-quarter (1.25) inch rainfall event through the utilization of BMPs, reduce existing imperviousness by
fifty (50) percent, or a combination of the two. These minimum standards should be achieved through the
following approaches:
(1)
Utilize BMPs appropriate to the scale and type of development and specific location, and design them for
effective and efficient long-term maintenance;
(2)
Consider the variation of conditions from one location to another, adjusting to the predevelopment green-to-grey
continuum, existing engineered elements, character of the soil, topography, or site geometry, intensity of
development, and other factors;
(3)
Minimize the need for grading and use creative grading techniques to manage stormwater runoff and encourage
more filtration;
(4)
Reduce the amount of impervious surface and disconnect impervious surfaces by directing runoff from rooftops,
sidewalks, driveways, or parking lots to landscaped areas or porous pavement;
(5)
Scrutinize setbacks, parking spaces, travel aisles, driveways, and sidewalks or walkways to see if any of these
elements can be reduced in scale;
(6)
Choose native plants that are easy to maintain, adapted to the local climate and soil conditions, and possess the
ability to intercept and hold rainwater and decrease water flow velocity; and
(7)</p>
<p>Maximize natural lands or existing vegetation set aside for conservation or preservation and protect them from
clearing, grading, and other construction-related impacts.
(e)
Ministerial exceptions. Jefferson Parish encourages property owners and developers to apply low impact
development techniques based on good land use planning and environmentally sound land use strategies. The
parish finds that flexibility in site design practices can promote low impact development while maintaining the
safety, health, and welfare of the public. To achieve the purposes of this section, for any application for low
impact development that demonstrates full compliance with the standards set forth above, the planning director
may approve any or all of the following ministerial exceptions:
(1)
Dimensional requirements.
a.
Decrease in minimum setback or increase in maximum setback, but no greater than fifty (50) percent of the
required minimum or maximum setback, as long as:
1.
The total required landscaped and buffer area for a site is not reduced;
2.
The required buffer between a commercial district and a residential district is not reduced; and
3.
The amount of the decrease or increase is the minimum amount needed to enhance or extend BMP on the site or
in public right-of-way adjacent to or in the same block as the property; and
b.
Increase or decrease in the maximum gross floor area of a building by up to twenty-five (25) percent where a
zoning district provides a maximum or minimum gross floor area.
(2)
Parking requirements.
a.
Reduce the total parking requirement by up to twenty-five (25) percent, as an approximation of the floor area
occupied by circulation and mechanical systems;
b.
Allow off-site parking to meet up to one hundred (100) percent of the required off-street parking, as long as the
off-site site has parking in excess of its required parking and the amount of required parking spaces being
reduced on-site is equal to the amount of excess spaces being provided off-site. The off-site site must be located
within six hundred (600) feet measured along and following a reasonable and safe walking route from the
nearest main entrance of the building or use to the off-site parking area; may be on land separated by a public
right-of-way, except roads classified on the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan as interstates, freeways, or major
arterials; and, shall be on land with a zoning district listed in section 40-661(3) for non-residential uses in nonresidential districts. All other requirements for a recorded parking agreement shall apply; and
c.
Allow shared parking between two (2) or more non-residential uses in the development, or between nonresidential uses in the development and off-site non-residential uses, whose peak parking demands occur at
different times. The applicant shall demonstrate, through peak use analysis approved by the parish traffic
engineer, that the number of parking spaces provided will satisfy the minimum off-street parking requirement for
all uses. An applicant may use the latest peak demand analysis published by the Institute of Traffic Engineers
(ITE) or other source acceptable to the parish traffic engineer. The off-site site must comply with the provisions
for an off-site site listed in subsection b above. All other requirements for a recorded parking agreement of
section 33-3.56.4(c), Shared parking, shall apply.
(3)
Landscaping requirements.

create a continuous opaque barrier, if the grasses or other plant materials are integral and necessary to the
functioning of a proposed BMP;
b.
Waive the requirements for interior parking lot landscaping that specify location and minimum widths of islands,
peninsulas, endcaps, and planting strips, provided that the minimum square footage of landscaped area and
quantity of landscape materials required is still provided on the site, if the alternative interior parking lot
landscaping layout is necessary for the proper functioning of the site's overall stormwater management system;
c.
Waive the requirement that sod be installed in all areas that are not plantings beds, provided that an alternative is
proposed that positively contributes to the site's overall stormwater management system;
d.
Waive the requirement for species diversity, if the applicant can demonstrate that meeting the diversity
requirement would be impracticable given the necessary design standards and constraints of the proposed
stormwater management system;
e.
Waive the requirement for mulch, provided that an alternative is proposed that positively contributes to the site's
overall stormwater management system; and
f.
Reduce or eliminate the requirement to irrigate the site, provided that the proposed BMPs provide the same
function.

<h5 id="sec-33-6355-shared-parking">Sec. 33-6.35.5. - Shared parking.</h5>
<p>(a)
Purpose. Shared parking is based on the fact that certain uses operate at different times over a twenty-four-hour
period with their greatest demand for parking occurring during mutually exclusive times. These uses are,
therefore, able to share parking spaces during particular times and under certain conditions the total number of
parking spaces otherwise required for individual uses may be reduced.
(b)
Generally. Where permitted, required parking may be satisfied, in whole or in part, with shared parking in
accordance with the requirements of this section.
(c)
Permitted uses and minimum development size.
(1)
In the Fat City districts, any development may utilize shared parking.
(2)
In all other zoning districts, only developments that are in single ownership and include the following uses
meeting the minimum thresholds may utilize shared parking:

Office uses totaling a minimum of three hundred thousand (300,000) square feet in gross floor area;
b.
Hotel uses containing a minimum of two hundred fifty (250) guest rooms;
c.
Retail uses totaling a minimum of fifty thousand (50,000) square feet in gross floor area;
d.</p>
<p>Theaters, auditoriums, sports arenas, and places of public assembly containing a minimum of one thousand five
hundred (1,500) seats; or
e.
Restaurant and lounge uses totaling a minimum of four thousand five hundred (4,500) square feet in gross floor
area.
(d)
Shared parking calculation. The application shall demonstrate that the number of parking spaces provided will
satisfy the minimum parking requirement by one (1) of the following methods:
(1)
Through peak use analysis approved by the parish traffic engineer, using the latest peak demand analysis
published by the Institute of Traffic Engineers (ITE) or other source acceptable to the parish traffic engineer; or
(2)
Through application of Table 33-6.35.5-1, Shared Parking Calculations, using the following steps:
a.
Determine the minimum parking requirement for each land use as if it were a separate use;
b.
Multiply each minimum required parking by the corresponding percentages for each of the five (5) time periods
set forth in Columns (B) through (F);
c.
Calculate the total for each time period; and
d.
Select the total with the highest value as the required minimum number of parking spaces.

<h5 id="sec-33-757-access-standards">Sec. 33-7.5.7. - Access standards.</h5>
<p>(a)
Purpose. The purpose of regulating the amount and nature of vehicular access points is to balance the need for
providing access to individual private properties with the need to preserve an adequate level of capacity on the
streets providing access. Vehicular access restrictions may be required to be shown on subdivision plats.
(b)
Access to arterials. Where a residential subdivision borders on or contains an existing or proposed arterial, the
Parish may require that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
(1)
Lots shall back onto the arterial and front onto a parallel collector or local street; no access shall be provided
from the arterial; or
(2)
A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered from and designed generally at right angles to
the arterial; or
(3)
A marginal access or service road separated from the arterial by a ten (10) feet wide planting strip and having
access at suitable points.
(4)
Secondary access. For public safety and convenience, secondary access shall be provided for any single family
residential development with thirty (30) or more homes, or any other development projected to generate more
than three-hundred (300) trips per day, or any development that derives its sole access from a street projected to
carry more than three-hundred (300) trips per day.
(c)
Railroads, interstates or major arterials. Railroad rights-of-way, interstates, and major arterials, where so located
as to affect the subdivision of adjoining lands, shall be treated as follows:
(1)
In residential zoning districts, buffers shall be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way, interstate or major
arterial. Buffers shall measure at least fifty (50) feet in width and shall include at least one tree every thirty-five
(35) feet and a combination of fencing, walls, berms and/or landscaping necessary to establish a six (6) feet tall
opaque buffer within two (2) years of plat approval. This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be
designated on the plat.
(2)
In districts zoned for business, commercial or industrial uses, wherever practicable, the nearest street extending
parallel or approximately parallel to the railroad right-of-way shall be at a sufficient distance from the railroad
right-of-way to ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
(3)
When streets parallel to the railroad right-of-way intersect a street that crosses the railroad right-of-way at grade,
they shall, to the extent practicable, be at a distance of at least one-hundred fifty (150) feet from the railroad
right-of-way. Such distance shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
(d)</p>
<p>Driveway permits. A driveway permit, issued by the inspection and code enforcement director shall be required
for all single family residences and any multiple family development encompassing five (5) or more dwelling
units. Driveway permits for all other uses shall be obtained from the public works director prior to the
construction of any new access point. When a traffic study is required, no driveway permit will be issued until
the traffic study process has been completed. For the purposes of evaluating driveway permit requests, the
boundary of the site is considered to be all contiguous parcels under the same ownership on the date of adoption
of this provision. Any non-residential change in use resulting in the following will require a new driveway
permit:
(1)
An increase of greater than fifty (50) peak hour trips, or
(2)
A ten (10) percent increase in average daily trips of an existing non-residential or multi-family development, or
(3)

vehicle weight.
(e)
Driveway design standards:
(1)
Dimensions. Unless required for emergency access, the minimum driveway width shall be twelve (12) feet for
residential and fifteen (15) feet for non-residential land uses, and the maximum driveway width shall be twentyfive (25) feet for residential and thirty-five (35) feet for non-residential land uses. The minimum thickness shall
comply with adopted improvement standards.
(2)
Approach. The driveways adjacent to paved roads shall provide a concrete driveway approach from the property
line to the roadbed edge.
(f)
Substandard access. Where access standards or design objectives of this UDC cannot be met, the public works
director shall be guided by the following process in determining whether substandard access may be permitted.
(1)
The public works director shall first determine whether alternate access to another street exists that meets the
standards of the Code.
(2)
Where alternate access opportunities are determined not to exist, the public works director may grant a reduction
in spacing standards of up to twenty (20) percent.
(3)</p>
<p>If after considering alternatives subject to subsections (a) and (b) above, the public works director determines
that no feasible alternatives exist, a substandard access permit may be granted as a subdivision waiver subject to
the following findings:
a.
Conditions or circumstances exist which limit the strict application of the requirements of this UDC, including
the lack of a secondary access to another public street, the inability to use joint access, and the lack of
engineering or construction solutions that can be applied to mitigate the condition;
b.
The proposed access will not result in undue delay or congestion or be detrimental to the safety of motoring
public using the roadway; and
c.
The limiting access will create an exceptional and undue hardship on the applicant and that the permit issued
will allow a reasonable use of the property.

<h5 id="sec-33-7510-traffic-impact-analysis">Sec. 33-7.5.10. - Traffic impact analysis.</h5>
<p>The intent of this Section is to provide the information necessary to allow decision-makers to assess the
transportation implications of traffic associated with a proposed development, to address the transportationrelated issues associated with development proposals that may be of concern to neighboring residents, business
owners and property owners, and to provide a basis for negotiation regarding improvements and funding
participation in conjunction with an application for development. This Section establishes requirements for the
TIA and evaluation of transportation impacts associated with proposed developments.
(1)
Purpose. A traffic impact analysis ("TIA") will be required for certain permitted and special permitted uses,
major subdivisions and site plans exceeding specific trip generation thresholds. The purpose of a traffic impact
analysis will be to:
a.
Evaluate traffic operations and impacts at site access points under projected peak period traffic loads;
b.
Evaluate the impact of site-generated traffic on affected intersections in the vicinity of the development site;
c.
Evaluate the impact of site-generated traffic on the quality of traffic flow within a reasonable distance of the site
of development;
d.
Evaluate the impact of the proposed development on neighborhood collector or local streets in the vicinity of the
site;
e.
Ensure that site access and other improvements needed to mitigate the traffic impact of the development meet
commonly accepted engineering design standards;
f.
Ensure that adequate facilities for pedestrians, transit users and bicyclists have been provided;
g.
Identify transportation infrastructure needs and related costs created by the development and cost sharing on
needed improvements.
(2)
Applicability. Traffic impact analysis shall be required for any amendments to the official zoning map or future
land use map, subdivision review, special permitted use, or site plan under the following described conditions; or
as otherwise required in the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances:
a.
The proposed use will generate seven-hundred fifty (750) or more average daily trips, according to most current
versions of the Institute of Transportation Engineers ("ITE") Trip Generation Informational Report or
comparable research data published by a public agency or institution; or
b.
The proposed development will concentrate one-thousand five-hundred (1,500) or more trips per day through a
single access point; or
c.</p>
<p>The proposed development will include thirty (30) or more dwelling units taking sole access from an existing or
planned neighborhood collector or local street; or
d.
The proposed development will include a drive-through facility or structural parking lot entrance that will result
in traffic spillover onto a public street, when eight (8) or more vehicles are queued at the facility; or
e.
Any residential project accessing an arterial street; or
f.
Any development that is subject to a state requirement for a traffic impact study. [8-31-2011]
(3)
Waiver. The requirements of this section for a TIA may be waived by the planning director, public works
director and parish traffic engineer when it is determined that such report is not necessary to determine needed
road improvements or that no unsafe or hazardous conditions will be created by the development as proposed.
(4)
Preparation. The TIA shall be prepared by a licensed professional engineer or AICP certified planner with
qualifications and no less than five (5) year's experience in the preparation of traffic analyses.
(5)
Traffic service standards. The standards for traffic service that shall be used to evaluate the findings of traffic
impact studies are:
a.
Level of service. For collector or local streets, a level of service ("LOS") "C" or better shall be maintained. On
any arterial or higher order street a LOS "D" or better shall be maintained. Where the existing LOS is below
these standards, the TIA shall identify those improvements required to ensure that development related traffic
demands result in no net reduction in LOS, and identify additional improvements needed to raise the level of
service to the standards on the arterial or higher order street to the adopted LOS standard.
b.
Number of access points. The spacing of access points shall comply with applicable parish, state and American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ("AASHTO") standards.
c.
Neighborhood collector or local street impact. Average daily traffic ("ADT") on neighborhood collector or local
streets shall be within the ranges spelled out in the thoroughfare plan for the class of street involved. No nonresidential development shall increase the traffic on a neighborhood collector or local street with at least threehundred (300) average daily trips by more than twenty-five (25) percent.
d.
Internal circulation. On-site vehicle circulation and parking patterns shall be designed so as not to interfere with
the flow of traffic on any public street and shall accommodate all anticipated types of site traffic.
e.
Safety. Access points shall be designed to provide for adequate sight distance and appropriate facilities to
accommodate acceleration and deceleration of site traffic.
f.
Curb space use plan. Details shall be provided on curb space use on public streets along the edge of the
development site when it is intended that such areas be used for parking, parking space access, delivery and
loading zones, passenger zones, taxi cab stands, bus stops, fire zones and/or other official/emergency zones. This
review shall include a description of existing conditions prior to development, and proposed changes resulting
from the development, including a description of any loss or gain in curb space use by the activities intended.
(6)
Contents. A TIA shall contain information addressing the factors listed below.
a.
Site description. The TIA shall contain illustrations and narrative that describe the characteristics of the site and
adjacent land uses as well as expected development in the vicinity which will influence future traffic conditions.
A description of the proposed development including access plans, staging plans and an indication of land use
and intensity, shall be provided.
b.
Study area. The TIA shall identify the geographic area under study and identify the roadway segments, critical
intersections and access points to be analyzed. The study shall include all intersections and access points to the
development and with all arterial and collector streets and/or all arterial and collector street intersections located
on the approaches within one-half (1/2) mile of the site. If no arterial street intersection is so located, the study
area may be extended to the nearest arterial street intersection if the proposed development is projected to
contribute at least five (5) percent of the traffic at that intersection at the time of development, unless determined
otherwise by the planning director and parish traffic engineer.
c.
Existing traffic conditions. The TIA shall contain a summary of the data used in the analysis of existing traffic
conditions, including:
1.
Traffic count and turning movement information, including the source of and date when traffic count
information was collected;
2.
Correction factors that were used to convert collected traffic data into representative design hour traffic volumes;
3.
Roadway characteristics, including the design configuration of existing or proposed roadways, existing traffic
control measures (speed limits, traffic signals, etc.) and existing driveways and turning movement conflicts in
the vicinity of the site; and
4.
The existing LOS for roadways and intersections without project development traffic using methods documented
in the Special Report 209: Highway Capacity Manual or latest edition, published by the Transportation Research
Board, or comparable accepted methods of evaluation. LOS shall be calculated for the weekday peak hour and,
in the case of uses generating high levels of weekend traffic, the Saturday or Sunday peak hour as determined by
the parish traffic engineer or planning director.
d.
Horizon year(s) and background traffic growth. The report shall identify the horizon year(s) that were analyzed
in the study, the background traffic growth factors for each horizon year, and the method and assumptions used
to develop the background traffic growth. Unless otherwise approved by the parish traffic engineer or planning
director, the impact of development shall be analyzed for the year after the development is expected to be at full
occupancy.
e.
Traffic assignment. The report shall identify projected design hour traffic volumes for roadway segments,
intersections or driveways in the study area, with and without the proposed development, for the horizon year(s)
of the study, including:
1.
Traffic count and turning movement information;
2.
Correction factors that were used to convert collected traffic data into representative design hour traffic volumes;
3.
Roadway characteristics, including the design configuration of existing or proposed roadways, existing and
proposed traffic control measures (speed limits, traffic signals, etc.) and existing and proposed driveways and
turning movement conflicts in the vicinity of the site; and
4.
The existing and proposed LOS for roadways and intersections without project development traffic using
methods documented in the Special Report 209: Highway Capacity Manual or latest edition, published by the
Transportation Research Board, or comparable accepted methods of evaluation. LOS shall be calculated for the
weekday peak hour and, in the case of uses generating high levels of weekend traffic, the Saturday or Sunday
peak hour as determined by the parish traffic engineer or planning director.
f.
Mitigation/alternatives. In situations where the traffic level of service standards are exceeded, the report shall
evaluate each of the following alternatives for achieving the traffic service standards:
1.
Identify where additional right-of-way is needed to implement mitigation strategies;
2.
Identify suggested phasing of street or intersection improvements where needed to maintain compliance with
traffic service standards; and
3.
Identify the anticipated cost of recommended improvements.
(7)
Process for the review and preparation of a TIA. The following steps provide an outline of the steps to be
included in the preparation and review of a TIA:
a.
The public works director, parish traffic engineer and planning director shall be consulted for assistance in
determining whether a traffic impact study needs to be prepared for a proposed development application;
b.
The public works director, parish traffic engineer and planning director shall meet with applicants to identify
study issues, assumptions, horizon years and time periods to be analyzed, analysis procedures, available sources
of data, past and related studies, report requirements and other topics relevant to study requirements. The
Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development ("LDOTD") District 02 Traffic Engineer or
designated representative shall be contacted and coordinates with as appropriate when the TIA includes state or
federal highways as points of access for a development;
c.
Following initial completion of a traffic impact analysis, the TIA shall be submitted to the planning director for
distribution to the staff of all jurisdictions involved in the construction and maintenance of public roadways
serving the development;
d.
Within ten (10) working days, staff shall complete an initial review to determine the completeness of the TIA
and shall provide a written summary to the applicant outlining the need for any supplemental study or analysis to
adequately address any deficiencies. A meeting to discuss the contents and findings of the TIA and the need for
additional study may be requested by the applicant;
e.
Following a determination that the technical analysis is complete, staff shall prepare a report outlining
recommendations that have been developed to address the findings and conclusions included in the study
regarding the proposed development's access needs and impacts on the transportation system. Depending on the
type of application, the recommendations may be presented to the PAB and/or Parish Council.
f.
In the case of a traffic impact analysis showing deficiencies requiring mitigation within the public right-of-way,
negotiations based on the conclusions and findings resulting from the traffic study shall be held with the public
works director, parish traffic engineer, planning director and parish attorney. A development agreement,
detailing the applicant's responsibilities and the parish's responsibilities for implementing identified mitigation
measures, shall be prepared following the negotiations for final action by parish council and the applicant.
(8)
Report findings. If staff finds that the proposed development will not meet applicable service level standards,
staff shall recommend one or more of the following actions by the public or the applicant:
a.
Reduce the size, scale, scope or density of the development to reduce traffic generation;
b.
Divide the project into phases and authorize only one (1) phase at a time until traffic capacity is adequate for the
next phase of development;
c.
Dedicate right-of-way for street improvements;
d.
Construct new streets and intersection improvements;
e.
Expand the capacity of existing streets;
f.
Redesign ingress and egress to the project to reduce traffic conflicts;
g.
Alter the use and type of development to reduce peak hour traffic;
h.
Reduce background (existing) traffic;
i.
