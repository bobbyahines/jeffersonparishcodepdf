<p>For the purposes of this article, unless the context clearly otherwise requires or unless otherwise defined in
specific portions of the article, the following words shall have the respective meanings ascribed to each in this
section:
(1)
Contractor. "Contractor" is synonymous with the term "builder" and means a person, firm, partnership,
corporation, association or other organization, or a combination of them, which undertakes to or offers to
undertake to, or purports to have the capacity to undertake to, or submits a bid to, or does himself or by or
through others, construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve, move, wreck or demolish any building,
highway, road, railroad, excavation or other structure, project, development or improvement, or to do any part
thereof, including the erection of scaffolding or other structure or works in connection therewith and includes
subcontractors and specialty contractors. As such, the word "contractor" shall include oil field service
contractors, which shall consist of those contractors performing general oil well servicing, maintenance, and
construction when conducted as a single company unit. General oil well servicing shall include welding, pipe
coating, pipe inspection, wireline service, automation, workover, logging, analysis, seismograph, installing and
servicing equipment, packing, platform work, perforating and completion.
(2)
Separate location. As used in section 35-159 of this article, a separate location exists unless a similar or
associated type of business is operated as a unit under a single roof or on the same contiguous tract of land.
(3)
Contractor's gross receipts. For the purposes of computing the license fee provided for in section 35-175 of this
article, a contractor's gross receipts are determined the same for all contractors, whether or not they have a lump
sum contract or a cost-plus contract. The gross receipts for a lump sum contract are based on the actual amount
of the contract, whereas the gross receipts for a cost-plus contract are based on the actual cost of the contract to
the owner including the amount added thereto as a fee.
(4)
Collector. For the purpose of this article, the collector is the sheriff and ex officio tax collector for the parish,
whose duty is to receive and collect the taxes and money due the parish.
(5)
Wholesale dealer. For the purpose of this article, except as specifically provided in this article, a "wholesale
dealer" means any person who sells to other dealers who in turn resell.
(6)
Retail dealers to institutional consumers. For the purpose of this article, a "retail dealer to institutional
consumers" includes all businesses selling, at retail from a fixed place of business, merchandise to dairymen,
cattlemen, or farmers, to federal, state, parish, or municipal governments or institutions, to educational or
charitable institutions, to hospitals, manufacturers, public utility companies, processors, refiners, fabricators,
contractors, severers of natural resources, carriers of freight or passengers, pipelines, hotels, and restaurants
provided that such sales constitute the major portion of the business.
(7)
Peddler. For the purpose of this article, a "peddler" means any person who, for himself or any other person, goes
from house to house, or place to place, or store to store, exposing and selling the merchandise which he carries
with him and delivering the same at the time of or immediately after the sale or without returning to the base of
business operation between the taking of the order and the delivery of the goods; however, any person who uses
the same vehicle or a combination of one (1) or more vehicles for the purpose of taking orders and delivering
merchandise, regardless of the fact that the vehicle returns to the base of operations between the taking of the
order and the delivery of the merchandise, shall be deemed a peddler, unless such person can show that the
merchandise delivered is accompanied by an invoice or delivery ticket prepared at the base of operations and
which conforms to the original order and that the person delivering the merchandise has permitted no deviation
from the original order by allowing the purchaser to reject, cancel, increase or decrease the quantity at the time
of delivery or to offset against such quantity any merchandise delivered at a prior time which is being returned.
This extension of the meaning of the term "peddler" shall not be interpreted so as to prevent rejection or
cancellation of bona fide orders or the return of inferior merchandise, but shall be construed so as to prevent
persons peddling merchandise from escaping their tax liability by subterfuge through means of so-called
"standing order" or blanket advance orders, increase and decrease in quantities at the time of delivery, arbitrary
rejections and cancellations, and offset of merchandise returned by reason of nonsale rather than obligation of
warranty, all of which are hereby declared to be mere devices to prevent normal methods of operations so as to
disguise the business of a peddler as an ordinary wholesale business. "Peddler" shall include but is not limited to
hawkers, itinerant vendors, and any retail dealers not having a fixed place of business.
(8)
Real estate broker. For carrying on each business of real estate broker, the license tax shall be based on gross
income. "Gross income" for real estate brokers is defined as those fees from any source deposited into the real
estate broker's agency's general fund account less escrow deposits, and less fees paid to operating real estate
brokers. Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, the maximum amount paid by a real estate
broker shall be twenty-two hundred dollars ($2,200.00).
(9)
Business. "Business" includes:
a.
Any business, trade, profession, occupation, vocation, or calling; and
b.
Any activity engaged in by any person or caused to be engaged in by a person with continuity or regularity with
the object of gain, benefit, advantage, income or profit, either direct or indirect, regardless of whether the
activity involves physical labor or physical work; and
c.
Any activity engaged in by any person or caused to be engaged in by a person through or by an agent,
representative, manager, officer, director or employee, that qualifies as business under either of sub-parts a. or b.
(10)
Person. "Person" includes an individual, firm, corporation, partnership, association or other legal entity.

period is from January first to the date of sale or change of lessee. A "change of ownership" occurs when a
business is sold or leased, and does not include changes in partnership or corporate shares.
(b)
The new owner or lessee shall obtain another business license, as the license issued to the former owner or

<p>In order to calculate the license fee for a business location at which business activities are carried on that fall
under more than one (1) tax basis schedule, gross receipts, fees, or commissions for each group of activities
falling under each schedule must be compared. The rate for the schedule which constitutes the major portion of
the gross receipts, fees or commission will be used. However, the total gross receipts, fees or commissions for all
business activities carried on at the business location, minus any applicable deductions, are applied to the
schedule to compute the fee.

<p>(a)
The basis for determining the amount of the annual licenses provided by this article, where the license is
measured by gross receipts, shall be as follows:
(1)
If the business has been conducted previously by the same party, the annual gross receipts, gross fees, or gross
commissions earned, whether received or accrued, during the preceding calendar year for which the license is
issued shall be the basis for determining the amount of the annual license.
(2)

commencement shall be based on the gross receipts, gross sales, gross premiums, gross fees, or gross
commissions earned, regardless of whether received or accrued during the first thirty (30) days of business,
multiplied by the number of months, or major fraction thereof remaining in the calendar year; however, any
business which opens after June thirtieth of the year in question whose estimated gross receipts for the remainder
of the year are less than one-half (½) of the maximum gross revenue allowed in the minimum rate under the
classification of the particular business shall pay for the remainder of the year at one-half (½) the minimum rate.
(3)
If the business is begun less than thirty (30) days before the end of the calendar year for which the license is to
be issued, the tax shall be based on the gross receipts, gross sales, gross premiums, gross fees or gross
commissions earned, regardless of whether received or accrued, during the calendar year; however, one-half (½)
of the annual rate shall apply to such businesses who gross receipts for the period operated during the calendar
year is less than one-half of the maximum gross revenue allowed in the minimum rate under the classification of
the particular business.
(4)
The license tax of the business for the calendar year following that of commencement shall be based on the gross
receipts, gross sales, gross premiums, gross fees or gross commissions earned, regardless of whether received or
accrued, during the previous year, divided by the number of days in operation during the year of
commencement, and multiplied by three hundred sixty-five (365).
(b)
The date of beginning business for the purposes of this article shall depend upon the type of business involved,
and shall be governed by regulations promulgated by the collector of revenue according to law.

disposed of as therein provided.
