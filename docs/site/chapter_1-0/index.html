<p>(a)
Ordinances vetoed by the president shall be submitted to the council by the parish clerk no later than the next
regular meeting held after publication of the veto statement. The parish clerk shall notify the council, as a body,
at its next regular meeting by placing the president's veto statement in the "reports and notices" portion of the
council agenda for that meeting; if the veto statement is received after the publication of the agenda, the parish

member.
(b)
Any council member may request the parish clerk to have the vetoed ordinance placed on the "veto override"

the veto statement. The vetoed ordinance, identified by its original summary number, shall be placed on the
agenda when so requested.
(c)
The motion to override the ordinance shall be the only matter for council consideration. There shall be no
amendments or substitutions to the original ordinance as adopted and vetoed. If the motion to override the veto
of the ordinance receives a favorable vote of at least two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the council's authorized membership,
said ordinance shall be considered finally enacted and become law irrespective of the veto by the president. No
public hearing is required on the council's veto override action.

<h5 id="sec-1-7-supplementation-of-code">Sec. 1-7. - Supplementation of Code.</h5>

By contract or by parish personnel, supplements to this Code shall be prepared and printed whenever authorized
or directed by the parish council. A supplement to the Code shall include all substantive parts of permanent and
general ordinances passed by the parish council during the period covered by the supplement and all changes
made thereby in the Code. The pages of a supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the
Code and will, where necessary, replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new
pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the
adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement.
(b)
In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of the Code which have been repealed shall be excluded
from the Code by the omission thereof from reprinted pages.
(c)
When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or organization authorized
to prepare the supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances
included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a unified Code. For example,
the codifier may:
(1)
Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
(2)
Provide appropriate catchlines, headings, and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the
supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings, and titles;
(3)
Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code, and, where necessary
to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers;
(4)
Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division,"
etc., as the case may be, or to "sections <strong><em>_</em> to </strong>___ "(inserting section numbers to indicate the sections of
the Code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance incorporated into the Code); and
(5)
Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted
into the Code; but, in no case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material
included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.</p>
<h5 id="sec-1-8-altering-code">Sec. 1-8. - Altering Code.</h5>
<p>It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend by additions or deletions, any part or portion of this
Code, or to insert or delete pages or portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with such Code in any manner
whatsoever which will cause the law of the Parish of Jefferson to be misrepresented thereby.
