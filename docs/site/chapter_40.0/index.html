--- (1) --Editor's note— Ord. No. 20783, § 3, adopted Sept. 22, 1999, adopted new zoning provisions. Said provisions
have been designated as Ch. 40. See the Code Comparative Table.
Annotations—Petitioners granted nonconforming use of their property as they had purchased and commenced
construction of business building on unzoned property and would have completed same but for restraining order,
before adoption of an ordinance on May 14, 1947 and special election held thereunder, creating Residential
District No. 1, and special election held thereunder. Ransome and Moise v. Police Jury, No. 20 105, 24th Jud.
Dist. Ct., Parish of Jefferson. Reversed on appeal as zoning ordinance prohibited "establishment of places of
business" and appellees had not established their business. Ransome and Moise v. Police Jury, 45 So.2d 601 (La.
1950). Plaintiff sought injunction to prevent Parish from revoking his permit for extension of nonconforming
use which was denied because he did not comply with requirements for obtaining same, in that, one, his required
assents from landowners was from leaseholder and further he was building only 7 ft. rear yard abutting adjacent
residential property where zoning ordinance required 15 ft. Comeaux v. Parish of Jefferson, 164 So.2d 123 (La.
App. 1964). Mandamus for issuance of building permit reversed. Administrative remedies were not exhausted
as appeal had not been made to Zoning Appeals Board. State v. Donelon, et al., 173 So.2d 24 (La. 4th Cir. 1965).
Ord. No. 2952-A, adopted November 16, 1955, declared null and void as Police Jury had not followed proper
procedure in its adoption. Viosca v. Police Jury, No. 36 752, Div. "A," 24th Jud. Dist. Ct., Parish of Jefferson.
Ord. No. 3192, adopted May 23, 1956, declared null and void as Police Jury had not followed proper procedure
in its adoption. Multicraft, Inc. v. Police Jury, No. 38 362, Div. "C," 24th Jud. Dist. Ct., Parish of Jefferson. In
suit to enjoin construction of apartment building in residential district, court said apartments used for residential
purposes come within the definition of residential use and are not prohibited. Orner v. Goesling, No. 42 083,
Div. "B," 24th Jud. Dist. Ct., Parish of Jefferson. Ordinance No. 6218 amending Comprehensive Zoning
Ordinance, Ord. No. 3813, declared null and void for the reason that its adoption did not conform to requirement
that it be adopted within 90 days of the public hearing thereon. Parish of Jefferson v. W. Jefferson Professional
Medical Plaza, Inc., No. 79 224. Div. "C," 24th Jud. Dist. Ct., Parish of Jefferson.

<p>The Old Metairie Neighborhood Conservation District is intended to promote the health, safety, economic,
cultural, and general welfare of the populace of Jefferson Parish by encouraging the conservation and
enhancement of the urban environment. The purposes of this district are:
(1)
To maintain neighborhood character and integrity by focusing special attention on the maintenance of the
physical environment; the enhancement of physical, social and economic resources and the accommodation of
desirable change;
(2)
To promote reinvestment in the neighborhood by fostering stable property values and enhancing the economic
viability of the neighborhood and the parish in general;
(3)
To preserve the mature architectural character of the neighborhood;
(4)
To set standards for the maintenance of the eclectic architectural quality of the neighborhood by guiding new
construction on residential parcels to be compatible with existing density and architectural styles;
(5)
To foster the harmonious, orderly, and efficient growth, development, and redevelopment of the parish;
(6)
To protect and preserve the existing tree canopy in an effort to maintain and add aesthetic appeal, increase
comfort and property values, temper climatic conditions, absorb rainwater thereby reducing impact on the
drainage infrastructure, and generally improve the quality of life; and
(7)
To encourage construction design reflective of traditional regional architecture that is in harmony with the
character of the district and reduces impacts from flooding, erosion, and sediment pollution to individual
properties and to the conservation district as a whole.

<h5 id="sec-40-180-preservation-and-maintenance-of-trees">Sec. 40-180. - Preservation and maintenance of trees.</h5>
<p>(a)
General.
(1)
Section 33-6.27, Tree preservation, shall apply. Where the provisions of section 33-6.27 conflict with those of
the MRTPD, the MRTPD shall prevail.
(2)
In addition to the trees identified as protected trees by section 33-6.27.4, the following trees shall be protected:
a.
The following species with a dbh of eight (8) inches or greater:
1.
All Oaks.
2.
All Elms.
3.
All Bald Cypress.
4.
Pecan.
5.
Magnolia, Japanese.
b.
Any tree, not identified as a protected tree, that contributes to the canopy of the MRTPD and has a dbh of at least
twenty-four (24) inches.
(b)
Application. Notwithstanding, and in addition to, any other permitting requirements stated in Chapter 8 or any
other chapter of the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances, prior to any construction activity as defined herein, in
the MRTPD, including but not limited to tree removal only, a property owner or his agent shall submit a Metairie
Ridge Tree Preservation District permit application to the department of inspection and code enforcement
showing any and all trees of eight (8) inches dbh or greater, including any tree(s) not defined as a protected tree.
Exceptions to the application and fee requirements are as follows:
(1)
When a property owner has no trees on his property or within ten (10) feet of the subject property line on
abutting property, the property owner may submit an affidavit to that effect with his building permit. This
affidavit releases the property owner from the requirements of this article.
(2)
When a property owner has no protected trees as defined in this article on his property or within ten (10) feet of
the subject property line on abutting property, the property owner may submit an affidavit with his building
permit signed by the property owner and certified by a landscape architect, a landscape contractor or an arborist
licensed as such by the State of Louisiana stating that no existing trees meet the "protected tree" qualification.
This affidavit releases the property owner from the requirements of this article.
(c)
Trees on abutting property. A property owner protecting trees on abutting property shall adhere to the following
requirements, as appropriate:
(1)
Abutting private property. A property owner on whose property construction activity may in any way affect a
tree located on property owned by another has the responsibility to get authorization from the owner of such
other property and to otherwise comply with all state laws regarding the cutting or trimming of tree limbs and
roots, including, but not limited to, La. Civil Code Articles 687 and 688 and La. R.S. 3:4278, before undertaking
any action related to any such tree, including, but not limited to, limb or root trimming. This authorization shall
be in writing and attached to the permit application. The issuance by the parish to a property owner of a permit
with conditions regarding trees on the property of a person other than the permittee does not relieve the
permittee of this responsibility.
(2)
Abutting public property. For trees on abutting public property, the issuance of a permit with the approved tree
protection plan is considered authorization by the parish in regards to the aforementioned state laws. Chapter 37,
Vegetation, of the Code of Ordinances regulates trees on public property, however, should there be any conflict
between those regulations and the regulations within this article, the more restrictive shall apply.
(d)
Uncontested removal area. Uncontested tree removal shall be allowed for all trees which have at least fifty (50)
percent of the base of the tree within the boundaries of the buildable area on the site as defined by the front and
rear yard setback requirements of the zoning district in which the property is located. Uncontested tree removal
shall also be allowed within the required side yard setbacks of the zoning district in which the property is
located. The property owner shall be allowed to remove any tree(s) within the uncontested removal area after
submittal of a MRTPD application and approval of such removal as part of a construction activity or tree
removal permit. There shall be no obligation for the property owner to fulfill the replacement requirements of
this article for trees removed from the uncontested removal area. Protection of trees located within the
uncontested removal area is at the discretion of the property owner.
(e)
Accessory structures. A property owner who wishes to place an accessory structure in the required rear yard
shall make every effort to accommodate the protected tree(s) in determining placement of the accessory
structure. In situations where there is no viable alternative placement, the parish arborist may recommend
approval of removal of a protected tree or trees to accommodate the accessory structure, with the replacement
guidelines of this article in effect.
(f)
Tree protection plan requirements. A tree protection plan is required for major construction activities as defined
in this article. Tree removal only, while defined as major construction activity, does not require a tree protection
plan; however, the parish arborist may require the submittal of a tree protection plan if, after the property owner
applies for tree removal, it is determined that the tree removal may be detrimental to other protected trees and
tree protection is necessary.
(1)
Removal of the tree protection measures shall occur when the construction activity is complete, and a certificate
of compliance has been issued by the department of inspection and code enforcement. If a property owner
wishes to begin landscaping his property prior to the issuance of the certificate of completion, he or his agent
may submit a written request to the department of parkway to request an inspection of the site by the parish
arborist. The parish arborist may authorize the removal of the tree protection measures prior to the issuance of a
certificate of compliance if it is his determination that the remaining construction activity will not have a
negative impact upon the protected trees. The parish arborist shall issue written notification to the property
owner and the department of inspection and code enforcement that authorization has been given or denied for
the removal of the tree protection measures.
(2)
At any time after the issuance of a permit for construction activity, the parish arborist may recommend to the
department of inspection and code enforcement that a "stop work order" be issued or a permit revoked and a
violation citation issued to protect trees in the MRTPD.

<h5 id="sec-40-321-description">Sec. 40-321. - Description.</h5>
<p>This district is composed of certain lands and structures used primarily to provide for the retailing of goods and
the furnishing of selected services. Regulations for the district are intended to permit and encourage full
development of the necessary commercial uses while at the same time protecting nearby residential areas from
possible adverse effects of the commercial activity. It is expected that future commercial uses requiring this
district classification will occur as planned compact shopping centers located in proximity to the residential
areas to be served. At such time as development of presently undeveloped areas of the parish warrants the
provision of additional commercial facilities, the planning director and the planning advisory board will evaluate
applications for such neighborhood commercial districts on the basis of the requirements described below. Upon
finding by the planning director and the planning advisory board that an area is suitable for and in need of a
neighborhood commercial district, the area may be zoned, provided, however, that a time limit may be placed on
the zoning action to insure that development of the commercial structure will be carried out within a reasonable
time. This limitation is important since a distinguishing feature of the district is the necessity for the actual
development to provide the surrounding residential area with the commercial facilities and services essential to
stable neighborhoods. In no case will the neighborhood commercial district exceed a maximum area of ten (10)
acres. Conditions of fact to be determined by the planning director and the planning advisory board as a basis for
neighborhood commercial C-1 classification.
(1)
That the neighborhood commercial district as proposed will not adversely affect the abutting residential areas.
(2)
That the site development plan of the neighborhood commercial district provides for adequate vehicular and
pedestrian access and circulation, and that the resulting concentration of traffic will not present problems of
safety or impede normal traffic movement on adjacent streets.
(3)
That the need for such neighborhood commercial district is justified on the basis of facts submitted by the
applicant, which clearly indicate that a present or potential market exists for the facilities and services proposed,
and that existing zoned neighborhood commercial districts cannot adequately satisfy these needs.

For developments with non-residential uses, the more restrictive land uses and the necessary off-site
improvements are completed first. For developments with separate multiple-family residential structures
developed and integrated with other permitted uses, the non-residential uses and the necessary off-site
improvements shall be completed first.
b.
Each phase can function and can be utilized independently of subsequent phases.
c.
At the time of the application the applicant submits a phasing schedule in accordance with section 40-450, Site
Plan Submittal, containing the following information:
1.
The number of phases in which the development will be built.
2.
The dates when the development of each phase is expected to begin and be completed. For the purposes of this
article and references thereto, the "beginning or initiation of construction" of a development shall be the date on
which a building permit is issued for the development or phase of the development and the completion of a
development shall be the date on which a certificate of use and occupancy (temporary or regular) is issued for
the development or phase of a development.
3.
The infrastructure and on-site improvements to be included in each phase including, but not limited to, service
areas, access drives, parking spaces, landscaping and open space, buildings and other structures.

<p>The purpose of the Commercial Parkway Overlay Zone (CPZ) is to superimpose an overlay zone utilizing
landscape and buffer standards to enhance the general quality of commercial and office development or
structures located on arterial streets or collectors as delineated in the Jefferson Parish Thoroughfare Plan; by
providing buffers to neighboring residences and other commercial uses; increase public safety by guiding traffic;
by minimizing the impact of commercial development and structures on the drainage system; by decreasing the
amount of paved area; and by coordinating green space and signage in commercial and office areas. Commercial
Parkway Overlay Zone requirements are imposed in addition to the underlying zoning district regulations and
development and structures within the overlay zone must conform to the requirements of both the district and the
overlay zone, or the more restrictive of the two (2).

<p>This district is composed of certain land and structures used to provide for the retailing of goods and the
furnishing of major services. This district characteristically occupies a larger area than the neighborhood
commercial district since it is intended to serve a greater population and to offer a wider range of services. Full
and complete development of all property in this district is of importance in order for the district to effectively
serve its economic function. These districts are in general located along major thoroughfares and future
expansion should desirably occur as an increase in depth of the district rather than further strip-like extension
along the thoroughfares.

<h5 id="sec-40-662-off-street-parking-requirements">Sec. 40-662. - Off-street parking requirements.</h5>
<p>Off-street parking spaces shall be provided on any lot for which any of the following listed principal or
accessory uses are hereafter established, subject to the following and the standards in the appendix of this
chapter:
(a)
A non-residential use in a residential district shall access all off-street parking only from the lot upon which the
principal use is located.
(b)
A maximum of twenty-five (25) percent of the required parking spaces may be designated for use by compact
vehicles. Compact vehicle parking spaces shall be identified by individually marking each parking space as
compact vehicle parking.
(c)
When a use is increased in capacity by the addition of dwelling rooms, guest rooms, floor area, seats or any
other requirement contained within this section that causes an increase in required off-street parking, the
maximum off-street parking shall be provided for such increase.
(d)
For the purpose of this section, when parking spaces are computed on the basis of the number of bedrooms, a
bedroom is defined as a room intended primarily for sleeping. Furthermore, any room in a dwelling other than a
kitchen, bathroom, and one (1) living room whether designated as a "den," "study," "media room," "gym," or
similar name denoting a room primarily intended for purposes other than cooking, sleeping, or personal hygiene,
shall be considered a bedroom.
(e)
When parking spaces are computed on the number of seats, and the structure, building or use utilizes bench,
bleacher, or similar seating rather than individual seats, then each eighteen (18) inches of bench, bleacher, or
similar seating shall constitute a seat.
(f)
When parking spaces are computed on the basis of the number of employees or other uses of the structure,
building or use, the maximum number present at any one time shall govern.
(g)
The calculation of required parking spaces shall not differentiate between indoor areas and outdoor areas
occupied by the use.
(h)
When computation of the number of required parking spaces results in a fraction of space, expressed as a
fraction or decimal, one-half (½) and over shall require one (1) parking space.
(i)
Off-street parking spaces shall only be used for off-street parking in connection with the principal use and
limited to the parking of passenger vehicles, trucks, and vans and not for storage of or access to containers or
trailers except as provided in section 40-750.
(j)
Parking and other vehicular use areas shall be paved with an approved all-weather hard surface, which may be
impervious or permeable or any combination thereof, and shall be properly graded for drainage and maintained
in good condition, free of weeds, dust, trash, debris and spillover of material onto public right-of-way or
adjacent property. Generally, the type of paving material used shall be manufactured for use as a parking surface.
The specific material used shall comply with standards and specifications established by the engineering
director, who shall make the final determination of suitability where uncertainty exists. The surface material(s),
underlying layer(s), and methods of structural and hydrologic design and installation shall be suitable to the
soils, water table depth, utility lines, public infrastructure capacities or standards, traffic or fire service loads,
trash or debris loads, intended use, or other site-specific factors, as indicated on drawings or in other documents
submitted to the parish for approval by the inspection and code enforcement director or engineering director, as
applicable. If the permeable paving is an integral part of a stormwater management system, the Maintenance
provisions of section 33-6.26, low impact development shall apply.
(k)
For all off-street parking facilities that are lighted, the light fixtures shall be designed, located, fitted, aimed, and
maintained to direct light and glare away from the adjacent residential districts and not interfere with traffic or
parking spaces.

<h5 id="sec-40-681-measurements">Sec. 40-681. - Measurements.</h5>
<p>(1)
Sign spacing. Detached and off-premises sign spacing shall be measured radially as the shortest horizontal
distance between any part of one (1) sign and any part of a second sign.
(2)
Setbacks. Setbacks shall be measured radially as the shortest horizontal distance between any part of a sign and
any perimeter lot line for the development site on which the sign is located.
(3)
Residential proximity. Residential proximity shall be measured radially as the shortest horizontal distance
between any part of a sign and any lot line of a residentially zoned property.
(4)
Sign area calculations. The sign area shall comprise the area within a line including the outer extremities of all
letters, figures, characters, and delineations, or within a line including the outer extremities of the framework or
background of a sign, whichever line includes the larger area.
a.
Double-faced sign. The area of one (1) face shall be the sign area.
b.
Cylindrical sign. The area of a cylindrical sign shall be one-half (½) of the circumference multiplied by the
height of the sign.
c.
Individual characters. The area of a sign made from individually cut out letters or symbols shall be the sum of
the area of rectangles and triangles necessary to enclose each character.
d.
Monument signs. The area of a sign shall not include the pedestal the sign is mounted on.
(5)
Sign height. Height of a monument sign shall be measured from a plane extended horizontally from the surface
of the existing adjacent sidewalk, or grade if there is no existing sidewalk, to the top of the sign and shall include
the pedestal.
(6)
EVM sign lighting. An EVM sign's lighting shall be measured using one (1) of the following methods:
a.
Illuminance measurement using a light meter.
1.
The distance (rounded to the nearest foot) from which the illuminance is to be measured shall be calculated
using the following formula:</p>
<p>Where:
x = Measurement distance in feet
L = Allowable luminance of the sign = 323 cd/m 2
A = Area of the sign in square feet
ΔI = Change in illuminance = 0.3 fc
2.
Based on the measurement distance calculated above, the illuminance shall be measured at a corresponding
distance perpendicular to the center of the EVM sign face. See Figure 40.681.1, Measurement point (plan view).</p>
<p>See Figure 40.681.1, Measurement point (plan view)
3.
The light meter's photocell shall be set up at the measurement point at a height of five (5) feet above grade. The
photocell shall be oriented to face the EVM sign panel. See Figure 40.682.2, Photocell orientation (elevation
view).</p>
<p>See Figure 40.682.2, Photocell orientation (elevation view)
4.
With the EVM sign displaying a solid white message, a measure of the illuminance shall be taken. For displays
which utilize one (1) color only, the message shall be the solid color of the display.
5.
With the EVM sign off, a measure of the illuminance shall be taken.
6.
The illuminance of the sign shall be measured as the change in illumination and shall be calculated using the
following formula:
ΔI = I max - I min
Where:
ΔI = Change in illuminance
I max = Illuminance measured with the sign on
I min = Illuminance measured with the sign off
b.
Luminance measurement using a nit gun. An EVM sign's luminance shall be measured as the brightest part of
the sign.
1.
The measurement point shall be located at a distance far enough from the EVM sign that individual LEDs (or
other light-emitting source) are not distinguishable but close enough such that only the EVM sign panel is
visible in the nit gun's eyepiece (LEDs are grouped in threes: one (1) red, one (1) blue, one (1) green. If these are
individually distinguishable the measurement point must be located further away).
2.
The nit gun's target area shall be focused on the brightest part of the sign, as determined by the director of
inspection and code enforcement or the director's designee, and a measurement shall be taken. See Figure
40.681.3, Target area.</p>

c.
Amortization of short-term rentals.
1.
Findings. The Parish Council finds that:
i.
Generally, Jefferson Parish is characterized by a suburban development pattern of homogenous land uses
concentrated in neighborhoods and along transportation corridors.
ii.
Where appropriate, mixed land uses are allowed to promote a denser, urban development pattern.
iii.
The most prevalent land use in Jefferson Parish is the detached single-family home, which comprises many,
quiet, well-maintained, and family-oriented neighborhoods.
iv.
The short-term rental of a home is a business that generally is not compatible with the homogenous residential
character of many of the Jefferson Parish's neighborhoods.
v.
Subject to use standards, the short-term rental of a home is compatible in mixed-use and commercial areas
where residential and nonresidential co-exist.
vi.
To promote health, safety, and the general welfare, and in accordance with the comprehensive plan, the
amortization of existing short-term rentals, within a reasonable timeframe is necessary so these activities either
cease operations where prohibited or come into compliance where allowed by the provisions of this Code.
2.
Purpose.The purposes of this section are to:
i.
Provide an adequate timeframe for operators of short-term rentals allowed as permitted uses by-right to come
into compliance with the standards and approval and licensing requirements provided for in this Code; and
ii.
Establish a fair and equitable process for the elimination of short-term rentals existing prior to the adoption date
of [the ordinance from which this section derives] and prohibited by new regulations.
3.
Amortization. Any short-term rental operating prior to [date of adoption of ordinance] shall have either twelve
(12) months to cease operations or six (6) months to compliance with standards, from said date to come into
compliance with one of the following, as applicable:
i.
If located in a zoning district where short-term rental is prohibited, shall cease operations. During the twelve
(12)-month period, the short-term rental shall be considered a nonconforming use and shall not be required to
adhere to the standards set forth in section 40-752(e)(7). However, upon termination of the amortization period,
the short-term rental shall cease operation immediately.
ii.
If located in a zoning district where short-term rental is permitted by-right, the short-term rental shall have six
(6) months to come into compliance with the standards set forth in section 40-752(e)(7), including all required
licenses.
d.
Long-term rental. Nothing in these short-term rental provisions is intended to apply to or prohibit the long term
rental of a dwelling unit for thirty (30) or more consecutive days and where typically the method of rental
involves an extended period of time and tenant obligations such as payment of utility bills in the name of the
tenant.

<h5 id="sec-40-793-limitation-of-powers-and-standards-for-board-action">Sec. 40-793. - Limitation of powers and standards for board action.</h5>
<p>The actions and decisions of the board of zoning adjustments shall be governed by the following standards and
restrictions:
(1)
Limitations.
a.
In exercising the above-mentioned powers, the board may affirm or reverse wholly or partly or may modify the
decision or determination appealed from and may make such other order, requirement, decision or determination
as said board may deem proper and within its authority. However, the board shall not render any judgment or
make any decision or determination which would constitute a zoning change.
b.
Whenever an appeal or application has been finally acted upon by the board, then the board shall not consider
any further appeal or application requesting the same or similar relief involving the same property within two (2)
calendar years from the date of the board's final decision on said appeal or application.
c.
If after the judgment granting a variance, exception or other relief prayed for, the operation authorized
thereunder is not commenced within two (2) years of the effective date of the board's decision, or if the
operation is commenced by the issuance of a permit and the work is discontinued for a sufficient period that the
permit expires or is allowed to lapse and is not resubmitted for approval within two (2) years of the effective
date of the board's decision, said judgment or decision shall expire, prescribe, lapse and/or be deemed to be
abandoned by appellant or applicant; and, no permit shall be issued in reliance of such judgment or decision
unless the matter is resubmitted to the board for consideration in the same manner as an original appeal or
application. The filing of the decision in the office of the board shall be the effective date of the judgment.
d.
In considering a variance, exception or other relief requested in connection with any property, the board shall
only consider such requests based upon the zoning classification of said property at the time the application is
filed.
(2)
Standards. The purpose of the "variance" provisions of this section generally permit an applicant to apply for
relief from the requirements of the letter of the ordinance when unnecessary hardship or practical difficulty
exists, or when there is an exceptional or unusual physical condition of a lot, which condition is not generally
prevalent in the neighborhood and which condition would prevent a reasonable or sensible arrangement of
building on the lot.
The purpose of the "exception" provisions of this section, whenever an exception requires the approval of the
board, generally permit the applicant to apply for use of land for purposes which may be essentially desirable,
necessary or convenient to the community, its citizenry or a substantial segment thereof but which require
special consideration of location and site plan because of an inherent tendency to create traffic congestion, noise,
density of persons assembling, or which may cause an excessive strain on water resources or sewerage disposal
facilities, or drainage, or which may cause a depreciation or diminution of value of the immediate surrounding
property, or may otherwise adversely affect safety or welfare of the immediate surrounding area.
a.
In the consideration of all appeals and all proposed variances and/or exceptions requiring board approval, under
the terms of this ordinance, the board shall not grant approval if it makes a finding, based upon the evidence
presented to it, as indicated in the record and the transcript of the hearing, that any of the following criteria exist:
1.
The approval, if granted, would cause diminution or depreciation of property values of any surrounding property
or would alter the essential character of the locality.
2.
The approval, if granted, would tend to degrade or retard the prosperity and general welfare of the neighborhood
and community.
3.
The approval, if granted, would be detrimental to the public welfare or seriously affect or be injurious to other
property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located, in that it will not: impair an
adequate supply of light and air; or increase substantially the congestions in the public streets, create a traffic
hazard, or permit inadequate parking; or increase the danger of fire; or substantially affect or overburden
existing drainage or sewerage systems; or otherwise endanger the public safety; or cause serious annoyance or
injury to occupants or adjoining premises by reason of emission of odors, fumes, gases, dust, smoke, noise or
vibration, light or glare, or other nuisances.
b.
Additionally, the board shall not grant approval of any variance unless it makes a further finding, as indicated in
the record or the transcript of the hearing, that each case shall indicate the following:
1.
Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and
which are not applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same zoning district; and the special
conditions and circumstances do not result from the intentional actions of the applicant or any other person who
may have or had interest in the property; and the strict adherence to the regulation for the property would result
in a demonstrable hardship upon the owner as distinguished from mere inconvenience; or
2.
Literal interpretation of the provisions of this ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed
by other properties in the same district under the terms of this ordinance; and granting the variance requested
will generally not confer on the applicant any special privilege which is denied by this ordinance to other lands,
structures, or buildings in the same district or similarly situated; and the purpose of the variance is not based
exclusively upon a desire to serve the convenience or profit of the property owner or other interested party.

<p>(a)</p>
<p>Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by a decision of the board of zoning adjustments, or any
officer, department, commission, board, bureau, district, or any other agency of the parish, may file a petition for
a writ of certiorari or other appropriate legal proceedings to review said decision with the Twenty-fourth Judicial
District Court in and for the Parish of Jefferson, setting forth that the decision is illegal, in whole or in part, and
specifying the grounds of the illegality. The petition, duly verified by the relator, shall be presented to the court
within a maximum time period of thirty (30) days after the filing of the decision in the office of the board. Upon
service of the petition for writ of certiorari, the board shall notify the court and the relator of all costs associated
with the preparation of the record, including the written transcript of the hearing. Upon receipt of these costs
from the relator, the board shall file with the court a certified copy of the proceedings before the board. The
return shall concisely set forth all papers, documents, photographs considered by the board, the judgment of the
board and reasons therefore, and such other facts as may be pertinent and material to show the grounds of the
board's decision.
(b)
Respondent. If the writ of certiorari or review is by an applicant who has been denied a permit or denied a
variance, or is otherwise appealing a decision, interpretation or action of denial by the director or the board, the
director may be the respondent in the proceedings before the Twenty-fourth Judicial District Court.
If the writ of certiorari or review is by an opponent challenging the granting of a permit, the approval of a
variance by the board, or otherwise appealing a decision, interpretation or action of approval by the director or
the board, the party receiving the permit or variance may be the respondent in the proceedings before the
Twenty-fourth Judicial District Court and the director may be an additional respondent if he is not otherwise
joined seeking writ of certiorari or review.
If the writ of certiorari or review is by an applicant who was granted a permit or approval by the director but the
actions of the director were reversed, wholly or partly, or the decision or determination of the director was
otherwise modified by the board, the opponent, successfully challenging the action before the board, may be a
respondent.
Any person or persons or, except as otherwise provided herein, any officer, department, commission, board,
bureau, district, or any other agency of the parish who may be jointly or severally affected by judicial review of

The court shall render a decision from the record of the board unless, following review of the board's record, it
shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the matter. The court may take
evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to the court with his
findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the
determination of the court shall be made. The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the
decision brought up for review. Costs shall not be assessed against the parish unless it shall appear to the court

APPENDIX A - RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PARISH
SALES AND USE TAX
Footnotes:
--- (1) --Cross reference— Sales and use tax, § 35-16 et seq.
Rule 1. - Integrated bracket.
The following integrated bracket schedule has been approved by the collector of revenue of the State of
Louisiana and is hereby designated as the bracket schedule for the purpose of tax collection within the meaning
of the ordinance:
Selling price</p>
<p>Amount of tax</p>
<p>1¢ to
12¢</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>No tax</p>
<p>13¢ to
42¢</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>1¢</p>
<p>43¢ to
82¢</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>2¢</p>
<p>83¢ to
$1.12</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>3¢</p>
<p>On sales above $1.12, the tax shall be 3¢ on each full dollar plus the above rates on a fractional part of a dollar.
Rule 2. - Remission of tax.
Of the total amounts collectible under the aforementioned schedule, one-third ( 1/3 ) of the amount thereof shall
be remitted by the dealers to the Parish of Jefferson. The remaining two-thirds ( 2/3 ) shall be remitted to the
State of Louisiana. In no event shall the tax remitted be less than the amount collected, regardless of percentage
relationship to total receipts.
Rule 3. - Motor vehicle sales.
With respect to sales of motor vehicles, the dealer shall give to the purchaser at the time of the sale, a certificate
signed by him showing the serial number, motor number, type and model of motor vehicle, and whether or not
the tax imposed by the ordinance has been paid.
If the tax has not been paid because the motor vehicle was taken in trade and is not subject to the tax, then the
dealer shall give to the purchaser a certificate so stating.
Rule 4. - Deliveries in Jefferson Parish.
The appropriate tax must be collected in all cases where tangible personal property is either purchased in or
delivered to a purchaser in the Parish of Jefferson. Where the merchandise is to be delivered by the seller to a
bona fide destination outside Jefferson Parish, the transaction is not taxable.
Rule 5. - Adjustments, replacements, and exchanges.
Where taxable articles are returned for adjustment, replacement or exchange under a guarantee as to its quality
or service and a new article is given pursuant to the guarantee, free or at a reduced price, the tax shall be
computed on the actual amount, if any, paid to the vendor on the new article.
Rule 6. - Returned merchandise.
In the event articles of tangible personal property are voluntarily returned to the seller by the consumer or
purchaser, before said articles have been used, but after the tax imposed by the ordinance has been collected or
charged to the account of the purchaser, and paid to the sheriff, the seller may deduct the sales price of such
article from the gross proceeds shown on his report for the current month. The records of the taxpayer must
clearly reflect and support his claim for all such deductions for merchandise returned for credit or refund, and
must especially show that the article returned has not been used and is in condition to be resold at the same price
originally charged.
If the merchandise is returned as being defective and a full refund is given, then a similar deduction may be
taken by the seller.
Rule 7. - Repossessions.
Where articles of tangible personal property are repossessed no deduction from gross sales proceeds shall be
made with respect to the repossession. If the repossessed article is later sold, such sale shall also be subject to
tax.
Rule 8. - Credit sales.
Dealers making credit or installment sales must report the total selling price of such sales and pay the total tax
thereon in the monthly tax period in which the contracts of sales are made, whether or not the dealer arranges to
receive payment of the tax in installments, or agrees that the contract may be discounted, or pledged with, or
sold to a finance company.
Rule 9. - Will-call sales.
A sale whose delivery is conditional on payment of the amount due is not completed until the amount due is
received by the seller, and is not taxable until the sale is completed.
Rule 10. - Sale of combustibles to users.
Sales of coal, coke, fuel oil, and other combustibles, except natural gas, whether sold in carload lots or other
quantities, to persons who use or consume such substances in producing other tangible personal property, or in
the rendering of service, constitute sales at retail within the meaning of the ordinance and are therefore taxable.
Sales of oxygen, acetylene, hydrogen and liquefied gases (including butane) to manufacturers, processors,
refiners, repairmen, contract welders, dentists, junk dealers, or for use as fuel or illumination, also constitutes
sales at retail within the meaning of the ordinance and are likewise taxable.
Rule 11. - Magazines and periodicals.
Sales of magazines, periodicals, and all publications other than newspapers, are taxable when sold to consumers.
Rule 12. - Ice.
Sales of ice by manufacturers and wholesalers to retail dealers who are actually engaged in the retail business of
selling ice to users or consumers, and which retailers have an established place of business, are sales for resale,
and resale certificates may be used. All other sales of ice are considered to be sales to consumers, or users and as
such, taxable. It is the intent of this rule that the only sales of ice which will be considered sales for resale are
sales made by wholesalers and manufacturers to established retail ice dealers.
Rule 13. - Computation of tax; transportation charges.
Whether or not freight, delivery or transportation charges may be deducted by the seller from the selling price in
computing the sales tax does not depend upon the separate billing thereof, but depends upon whether or not the
services rendered by the transporting agency are rendered to the seller or the purchaser.
If the seller contracts to deliver tangible personal property to some designated place, or is obligated to pay
transportation charges to some designated place, the transportation services are rendered to the seller, and the
transportation charges must be included in the selling price for the purposes of computing the sales tax. If the
seller contracts to sell tangible personal property f.o.b. origin, title passing at that point, and the purchaser pays
the transportation charges, then the transportation services are rendered to the purchaser, and the transportation
charges are not to be included in the selling price. These principles apply whether or not the transportation
charges are separately billed.
For example, where an automobile dealer sells an automobile from his stock, and title thereto passes to the
purchaser for use or consumption at the dealer's place of business, no deduction may be made for freight charges
incurred in bringing the automobile from the factory to the dealer's place of business even if the automobile is
sold and billed to the consumer on the basis of factory list price plus freight and other charges. Similarly, a
person selling lumber for use or consumption may not deduct from the selling price, any freight or delivery
charges accruing on account of the transportation of the lumber to his yard or warehouse. Likewise, he may
make no deduction for such charges for transportation from his yard or warehouse to his customer, if under the
contract of sale he is obligated to deliver the lumber to his customer at a designated place.
In all cases the determining factor is the place where title to the property passes to the user or consumer, and any
freight, delivery, or other transportation charges incurred and paid by the seller for the purpose of transporting
such property to such place are a part of the selling price for the purposes of computing sales tax.
Where property is sold on terms whereunder the seller agrees to deliver such property to a certain place, but the
purchaser pays the freight and deducts it from the seller's invoice price of the goods in making remittance to the
seller for the goods, the transportation charges are deemed a part of the selling price of the property for the
purposes of computing sales tax.
This rule applies only to Sales Tax and not to Use Tax.
Rule 14. - Computation of tax; installation charges.
Retailers of tangible personal property, who, in connection with their sales, contract for the installation of the
articles so sold, are vendors of the articles and material, in the same manner as in the case of articles sold
without installation. If the charges for installation are stated separately to the purchaser, such installation charges
will not be taxable. Failure to separately state the charges subjects the entire amount to the tax.
Rule 15. - Computation of tax; federal taxes.
The Federal Retailer's Excise Tax Act levies an excise tax on the sale of fur and fur trimmed coats, cosmetics,
leather goods, and jewelry, sold at retail, and requires the retailer to collect the tax from the user or consumer
and remit same to the federal government. Where this tax is billed to the consumer, separately from the selling
price of the items, the sales tax should be computed on the selling price excluding the Federal Retailer's Excise
Tax.
Other federal excise taxes are levied on the producer or manufacturer rather than the consumer and may not be
deducted from the selling price, even though the tax is invoiced separately to the user or consumer.
Federal processing taxes and taxes upon floor stocks are levied against, assessed upon, and paid by processors,
importers or holders of floor stocks and are deemed to be a part of the selling prices thereof, and are likewise not
to be deducted from the selling price.
Rule 16. - Computation of tax; finance and service charges.
Finance charges, carrying charges or interest charges, arising from credit extended on sales under installment
sale contract or other installment contracts providing for deferred payment of the purchase price are not
considered a part of the selling price if such charges are separately stated to the customer and do not exceed
eight (8) percent per annum. If the charges exceed eight (8) percent the excessive portion shall be considered a
part of the selling price and as such, taxable.
Service charges such as notarial fees, transfer of title fees, recording fees, and similar charges are not considered
a part of the selling price if such charges are separately stated to the customer and do not exceed six (6) percent
of the amount financed. If such charges exceed six (6) percent of the amount financed, the excessive portion
shall be considered a part of the selling price and as such, taxable.
Failure to separately state finance or service charges from the basic sales price subjects the entire amount to tax.
Rule 17. - Sales for lease or rental purposes.
A sale of tangible personal property to a person who leases or rents same is a retail sale and subject to the tax.
The fact that the purchaser is registered as a dealer and collects tax on his gross rentals does not affect the
taxability of the sale.
Rule 18. - Lease or rental of tangible personal property.
Lessors shall collect tax upon total rentals due them by lessees of all kinds and types of tangible personal
property. The terms of the contract under which such property is leased or rented shall be the basis for collecting
and remitting the tax. The tax shall be computed on the basis of the billing provided in the contract, which may
provide for either a lump sum at the time of execution or for monthly or other periodical payments. This tax is in
addition to the tax due at the time of the purchase of the property rented or leased.
Rule 19. - Labels, tags, or name plates.
Sales of labels, tags, or name plates to the manufacturer who affixes them to products manufactured by him are
considered to be sales for resale where such items become affixed to or an integral part of the product sold. This
includes printed matter containing only directions for uses where it is impracticable to affix such printed matter
to the product sold. This is not the rule with such labels and tags as price or shipping which become only
temporarily attached to the product sold.
Rule 20. - Containers, wrapping and packing materials, and related products sales.
When used in this rule, the term "containers" includes all containers, wrapping and packing materials, bags,
twines, wrapping papers, gummed tapes, cellophane, boxes, bottles, drums, cartons, sacks or other packing,
packaging, containing [containers] and wrapping materials in which tangible personal property may be
contained. Where persons engaged in the business of selling containers sell same to other persons for use by
such other persons in connection with shipping or delivering their own tangible personal property, or for use in
connection with rendering service, (whether taxable services or not), or for personal or other uses, the sales are
taxable. If the purchaser of the containers is engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property placed
in such containers to other persons, and title to such containers passes to such other persons, together with title to
the tangible personal property contained therein, the containers shall be deemed to be sold for the purpose of
resale.
If the purchaser of the containers is engaged in the business of selling tangible personal property placed in such
containers to other persons, and the title to such containers is retained by the seller of the tangible personal
property contained therein, and such containers are intended by the seller merely to provide a means for
containing tangible personal property while in the process of being delivered or conveyed to purchasers and are
to be returned to the seller for reuse, then the containers shall be deemed to be sold to the consumer, and the tax
must be collected.
A sale of paper napkins, towels, drinking straws, paper cups or plates, and similar items, when sold to a
purchaser for use in connection with the conduct of his business and not resold in their original state, is taxable.
Rule 21. - Premiums and gifts.
The purchase of goods to be given away as premiums or otherwise is not a purchase for resale and is therefore
taxable.
Rule 22. - Casual and isolated sales.
The exemption for casual and isolated sales by persons who are not engaged in the business of selling tangible
personal property does not apply to sales made by a person who holds himself out as engaged in a retail
business, even though the sales may be few and infrequent. Similarly, the exemption does not apply to
manufacturers, processors, wholesalers or jobbers engaged in distributing tangible personal property who sell
primarily other than retail, but who on occasion sell tangible personal property to purchasers for use or
consumption, even though the sales at retail comprise a small fraction of their total business. Likewise, the
exemption does not apply to a warehouseman who sells secondhand furniture or other tangible personal property
to which he has acquired title, in cases where he holds himself out to the public as being engaged in the business
of selling such property, but it shall apply in cases where sales are made at auction by the warehouseman in
order to satisfy his lien or claim on account of moving, storing or other service charges.
Rule 23. - Printed matter.
(a)
Sales by printers of advertising circulars, books, briefs, envelopes, folders, posters, round forms, shopping
guides, tickets, and other printed matter, to persons who do not resell such articles in the regular course of
business but who either consume them, lease them, or distribute them free of charge are subject to sales tax.
Sales of such matter to dealers for resale in the regular course of business are wholesale sales and therefore not
subject to the sales tax. A printer may not deduct from the selling price of such property the cost of labor,
author's alteration or other service charges in performing the printing, even though such charge is stated or
shown on any evidence of sale separately from the charge for stock. Such costs are considered part of the cost of
the completed articles sold.
(b)</p>
<p>If stamped envelopes or government postals are purchased and printed for customers or il stamps are provided,
the amount of the postage should be deducted in determining the sales price for taxable purposes.
(c)
Sales of printed matter to advertising agencies who purchase for their own use or for the use of their clients and
not for resale in the regular course of business are deemed to be sales for consumption.
(d)
Sales of tickets to theater owners, amusement operators, transportation companies, and similar operators are
sales for consumption.
(e)
Sales of school annuals and similar publications by printers to school districts, private schools, or student
organizations are taxable sales.
(f)
The furnishing of printing or overprinting, lithographic, multilith, blueprinting, photostating, or other similar
services of reproducing written or graphic matter with materials owned by others is a sale of services, and
charges therefore are subject to the sales tax.
(g)
Sales to printers of equipment, supplies and materials which do not become a component part or ingredient of
the finished printed matter sold are taxable. Such sales include sales of stationery, engraving, furniture,
lubricants, machinery, type, lead slugs, and mats.
(h)
Sales to printers of plates which can be used for a particular customer only are considered as being purchases for
resale. When the printing job is finished, and the plate is either delivered to the customer or is retained by the
printer for the customer's convenience, the printer should include in his bill to the customer the price of the plate
and collect the sales tax on the total price of both the printing and the plate.
If the plates are not peculiar to one particular customer but may be used by the printer in serving other
customers, the plates are considered to be purchased by the printer for his own use and tax should be paid by the
printer at the time of purchase.
(i)
Where business establishments buy plates from nonresident manufacturers and have their work done by
nonresident printers the plates are considered as being purchased for consumption and tax should be paid by the
business establishment at the time of the purchase.
(j)
Sales to printers of paper stock and ink which become a part of the printed matter sold are considered sales for
further processing and are not subject to the tax.
Rule 24. - Florists' telegraphic deliveries.
Where florists conduct transactions through a florists' telegraphic delivery association, the following rules will
apply in the computation of tax liability:
(a)
In cases where a Jefferson Parish florist receives an order pursuant to which he gives telegraphic instructions to a
second florist located outside the parish for delivery of property to a point outside the parish, the tax will be
computed on the total moneys received by the sending florist from the customer.
(b)
In cases where a Jefferson Parish florist receives telegraphic instructions from florists located outside the parish,
for delivery of property within the parish, no tax is due on any part of the transaction.
Rule 25. - Resale certificates.
All sales shall be treated as retail sales unless the seller takes from the buyer a resale certificate signed by and
bearing the name, address and registration number of the buyer, to the effect that the property was purchased for
resale, or to be used as an ingredient or a component part of a new article for sale at retail. The claim of a buyer
that the articles are purchased for resale may be recognized only if he is properly registered for sales tax
purposes. Sellers are responsible for the collection of the tax on all sales made to persons who have not received
the proper registration certificate (except in case of sales of fertilizer and containers made direct to farmers).
The burden of proving that a sale is in fact a sale for resale shall be upon the person who makes the sale. Claims
of purchasers must appear reasonable, consideration being given to the nature of their business. Any purchaser
who fraudulently signs a resale certificate without intent to resell the property purchased shall be deemed guilty
of a misdemeanor:
Dealers must keep all resale certificates signed to them by customers for examination by the sheriff. Any dealer
who fails to comply with the provisions of this rule will be liable for and must pay the tax himself. Resale
certificates and details pertinent thereto may be obtained from the sheriffs office (Sales Tax Division).
Rule 26. - Sales to Jefferson Parish.
Where construction materials, supplies, equipment or any other item of tangible personal property is sold to the
Parish of Jefferson or any of its departments or agencies, or to any contractor for use on projects for the parish of
its departments or agencies, the sales are taxable. It is immaterial that part or all of the funds by which payments
are made may have been advanced, granted, or loaned by the federal government to the parish or its agencies or
departments.
Rule 27. - Sales to the United States government and the state.
Sales to, or services rendered for the government of the United States and its departments or agencies, or to the
State of Louisiana and its departments or agencies, are exempt from the tax. This exemption applies only where
the sale is made and billed directly to the governmental body and is paid directly by such body. Any transaction
not strictly complying with the provisions of this rule shall be considered taxable.
Rule 28. - Machinists, foundrymen and pattern makers.
Machinists, foundrymen, and pattern makers who are engaged in fabricating and selling dies, castings, patterns,
tools, lathes and punch presses, machinery, or any other such property to manufacturers or other persons who
purchase same for use or consumption, are making sales at retail within the meaning of the sales tax ordinance.
No deduction may be made for labor or fabrication or other costs of production in computing the selling price
for tax purposes. Where structural steel, castings, or other such products are sold to construction contractors not
registered as dealers, the sales are considered retail sales. Machinists, foundrymen, and pattern makers who
repair property of others are liable for the tax on the full amount of the charges for such repair services.
Rule 29. - Tangible personal property made to order.
Where persons contract to fabricate articles of property such as portieres, curtains, tents, awnings, clothing, auto
tops, and the like, from materials in stock, which have been selected by customer, the total amount due shall be
the basis for sales tax purposes. No deduction may be made for labor or service charges of fabrication or
productions, notwithstanding that such charges may be separately billed to customers apart from charges for
materials.
Rule 30. - Sales by auctioneers, agents, and factors.
Every factor, auctioneer or agent acting for an unknown or undisclosed principal entrusted with any bill of
lading, customhouse permit or warehouseman's receipt for delivery of tangible personal property, or entrusted
with possession of any such property for the purpose of sale, shall be deemed the owner thereof, and the sale at
retail of such property shall be taxable. A sale by such factor, auctioneer or agent when acting for a known or
disclosed principal shall be taxable to the principal. The same rule applies to lien holders such as storage men,
pawnbrokers and artisans.
Rule 31. - Seeds.
Sales of seeds to a person who plants them in the soil for the purpose of growing agricultural products are
considered to be sales for use or consumption, rather than sales for resale, and are therefore taxable.
Rule 32. - Cold storage space.
For tax purposes, the term "cold storage space" means any enclosed space in which the temperature is regulated
or controlled through the use of machinery or chemicals capable of reducing the temperature of such space
below that of the outside atmosphere.
Rule 33. - Hotels and tourist camps.
For tax purposes, the term "hotel" means any establishment engaged in the business of furnishing sleeping
rooms primarily to transient guests where such establishment consists of ten or more guest (sleeping) rooms
under a single roof. If the establishment contains less than ten sleeping rooms, the tax does not apply. Similarly,
if more than half of the guests are permanent, the tax does not apply. But, if the establishment cannot be
excluded from the definition of "hotel" under either of the foregoing bases, the tax must be collected with
respect to the charges to all guests, permanent as well as transient.
The question of whether the guests of a particular establishment are transient guests must be determined on the
facts in each case. A guest who pays for a room by the month and who resides in the establishment for a long
period of time would not ordinarily be classified as a transient guest. On the other hand, one who pays for a
room by the day or by the week would ordinarily fall within the classification of a transient guest.
Where an establishment consists of sleeping rooms and apartments with facilities for cooking and eating, the
apartments are not included in determining the liability for tax. For example if there are eight sleeping rooms
furnished to transient guests, six sleeping rooms to permanent guests, and ten apartments to permanent guests,
the sleeping rooms constitute a "hotel" since more than half of them are furnished to transient guests—the
apartments being completely disregarded for the purpose of classifying the remaining rooms and are not subject
to the tax.
The term "tourist camp" means any establishment engaged in the business of furnishing rooms, cottages, or
cabins to tourists or other transient guests, where the number of guest rooms, cottages 2821 or cabins at a single
location is six or more. It should be noted that the classification is determined by the type of guests
accommodated and the number of units at each location. Whether cooking and eating facilities are furnished is
immaterial.
Rule 34. - Building materials.
Sales of materials and supplies to owners of real property to be used by them in erecting, altering, improving, or
repairing buildings, or other improvements are sales to final buyers, and are not sales for resale and are
therefore, taxable. In such cases, the purchaser of said materials pays the tax to the vendor who in turn remits the
tax as provided in the ordinance.
Contractors engaged in constructing or improving real property, whether on a lump sum or a cost-plus basis, are
deemed to be purchasers and consumers of the materials used by them. Vendors of such materials are required to
collect the tax thereon and to remit same to the sheriff.
Rule 35. - Contractor dealers.
Contractors and subcontractors engaged in the business of erecting, building or otherwise improving, altering
and repairing real property for others, may also be engaged in the retail business of selling materials and supplies
to other contractors, and consumers and users. If, at the time of purchase, the contractor is unable to segregate
that portion of the materials and supplies he will sell at retail and that portion which he will use or consume in
the fulfillment of his contracts, he should give a resale certificate to the seller of the materials and supplies. The
contractor or subcontractor purchasing on a resale certificate must include in his gross sales, upon which the tax
is to be computed, all proceeds from retail sales. In addition he will report and pay the tax on all materials he
uses in the performance of his contracts, based on the cost price of such materials and supplies.
Where the contract with the customer is expressed in terms of a sale of certain materials at a stipulated price,
plus a charge for installation, the contract shall be considered a taxable retail sale to the extent of the stipulated
price of the materials.
Where the contract is expressed in terms of a sale of certain materials, coupled with an obligation to install them,
for a lump sum charge, the entire charge shall be considered the selling price and shall be subject to tax.
Rule 36. - Contractor manufacturers.
Contractors and subcontractors who manufacture and install a manufactured product under contracts pertaining
to the erection, improvement, alteration or repair of real or personal property of others are dealers in the
manufactured products so installed, and shall collect from their customers the tax due with respect to the sales of
tangible personal property under such contracts. In instances where the contract or the invoice shows the cost of
installation separate from the price of the manufactured product sold, the tax applies only on the selling price of
the manufactured product, except where the installation charge would also be taxable as a charge for repairs to
tangible personal property. However, when no segregation has been made of installation labor from the price of
the manufactured product sold, the tax applies on the entire amount of the contract price.
The provisions of Rule 35 pertaining to contractor-dealers, insofar as appropriate, apply also to contractormanufacturers.
Rule 37. - Sign manufacturers and painters.
Persons engaged in the business of painting signs on buildings or other real or personal property belonging to
others are rendering services of a kind not subject to the tax, and their gross proceeds from such services are not
within the ordinance. Sales of paint, brushes and other tangible personal property to such sign painters are sales
to purchasers for use or consumption and the seller thereof must pay a tax measured by his gross proceeds.
Where a sign painter fabricates and paints a sign from his own materials and sells the same to a customer as a
finished article for use or consumption, he must pay the tax imposed with respect to his gross proceeds from
such sale. He may not deduct from the selling price the labor or service charge for painting.
Persons engaged in the business of selling to users or consumers electric, neon or other illuminated signs,
whether manufactured by themselves or not, are selling tangible personal property at retail and become liable for
the tax. If at time of such sales they contract to furnish periodical maintenance or repair service for a flat charge
including the purchase price of the sign, the total gross proceeds from the sale are within the ordinance.
Similarly, if the charges for maintenance or repair services rendered subsequently to the sale of signs are billed
separately to customers, such charges are taxed as "sales of services". If the main-taxable services, such as
insurance and inspection, the portion of the maintenance charge representing the cost of inspection and insurance
may be excluded from the tax provided such charges are segregated in the contract.
Rule 38. - Undertakers.
Undertakers and funeral directors are considered retail dealers for tax purposes in connection with caskets, grave
vaults, clothing and similar articles.
The embalming and the furnishing of hearses, family cars, and like services are considered nontaxable services.
Equipment, embalming fluids and other supplies purchased and consumed or used in the carrying on of this type
of business are considered purchases at retail and as such taxable.
Rule 39. - Certificates of registration.
Every person who is responsible for collecting and accounting for the tax, or who shall engage in any business
for which a tax is imposed under the ordinance shall apply for and obtain a certificate of registration for [from]
the sheriff. This requirement does not apply to persons whose entire gross proceeds of sales are expressly
exempt under the ordinance.
Persons, such as operators of leased departments or concessionaires, who are permitted, under certain
conditions, to include tax liability on the returns of the lessor, or grantor of the concession, instead of filing
separate returns nevertheless must apply for and obtain a certificate of registration.
Whenever a taxpayer transacts business in two or more separate places in the parish, a separate certificate of
registration shall be required for each place at which business is transacted with the public. An original
certificate shall be issued for the main office or principal place of business, from which returns are to be filed,
and a branch certificate for each other place in this parish at which business is transacted with the public. Where
the taxpayer's principal place of business is outside the parish, the original certificate shall be issued for such
place and a branch certificate for each place of business within this parish at which business is transacted with
the public.
Each certificate of registration shall be numbered and shall show the name of the taxpayer, the principal place of
business and the type of business engaged in. The branch certificate shall also show the location of the place of
business, for which it is issued, as well as the main office or principal place of business of the taxpayer.
The taxpayer shall cause the certificate of registration to be posted in a conspicuous place in the place of
business for which it is issued.
A certificate of registration is personal and nontransferable. The old certificate must be cancelled and a new one
secured when there is a change in ownership of a business.
No "change of ownership" occurs upon the transfer of assets to an assignee for the benefit of creditors or upon
the appointment of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy.
Whenever the place of business for which an original or branch certificate of registration has been issued is
changed, the taxpayer shall return the existing certificate to the sheriff for cancellation. A new certificate will be
issued for the new place of business.
If any original certificate of registration is destroyed or defaced as a result of accident or of natural wear and
tear, a new certificate will be issued to the taxpayer upon request.
Rule 40. - Consolidated returns.
Any person engaged in two or more forms of businesses of like classification taxable under the ordinance may
file a consolidated return covering all business activities of such like classification engaged in within the parish.
Such consolidated returns must be accompanied by a schedule showing the address of each place of business,
the gross sales, allowable deductions, net taxable sales and amount of tax due for each location.
Rule 41. - Leased departments.
Where a store has leased certain of its departments to other persons for the selling of tangible personal property
to consumers, each such leased department shall make separate monthly returns, if the lessee keeps his own
books and makes his own collections on accounts of sales at retail. If the store leasing such departments keeps
the books for the leased departments and makes collections on accounts of their sales, the store may, as agent for
the lessee, make separate returns for such departments and pay the taxes due. But the lessee shall not be relieved
of this liability under the ordinance in case the store fails to make the proper returns or fails to pay taxes due.
Rule 42. - Use tax.
The ordinance imposes a tax on the use, consumption, distribution and storage for use or consumption within
this parish of tangible personal property purchased in such manner that the sales tax does not apply thereto.
The Use Tax applies to the use of property purchases [purchased] in interstate commerce, or in other parishes for
the purpose of use in this parish after interstate commerce has ended. For purposes of taxation, interstate
commerce ends when purchased property reaches the consignee, and comes to rest within the parish. The tax
does not attach until the property has come to rest in the parish.
Generally, it may be said that the Use Tax applies to the use of property in this parish, the sale of which would
be subject to tax had there been a purchase within this parish. The Use Tax does not apply upon the use of any
property which is exempt from the tax imposed upon the sale at retail. The two taxes, sales and use, stand as
complements to each other and taken together provide a uniform tax upon either the sale at retail or use of all
tangible personal property irrespective of where it may have been purchased.
The Use Tax is based on the "cost price" of the tangible personal property. The cost price means the actual cost
of the property including transportation costs incurred in transporting the property to the place where it is to be
used. No deduction is allowed for materials used, labor, service cost, transportation charges or any other
expenses whatsoever.
Rule 43. - Imports by motor vehicles.
Any person or dealer desiring to import from outside the parish tangible personal property which is subject to
the tax by motor vehicle or by any means other than common carrier must first obtain from the sheriff a permit
stating the kind of vehicle to be used, the name of the driver, the license number of the vehicle, the kind of
tangible personal property to be imported, the date, the name and address of the consignee, and such other
information as the sheriff may deem necessary. Any person or dealer importing tangible personal property
subject to tax without first obtaining such permit, will subject the said motor vehicle and taxable property to
seizure and forfeiture. Such permits shall be free of cost to the applicant and may be obtained from the sheriff at
the Sales Tax Office at 3800 Airline Highway in Jefferson Parish.
