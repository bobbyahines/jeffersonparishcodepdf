official of the parish or any person on the ground that his testimony or answers would tend to incriminate him, or

testify at such hearing or inquiry, such action may be grounds for the application of an adverse presumption
against the official unless good cause is shown as to why the official refused to appear, refused to testify, or
refused to waive immunity.

financial disclosure statement is filed or at any time thereafter, except at any time after a request for inspection
of the statement has been filed with the parish attorney, submit a request to the parish attorney to withhold from

constitute an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the person required to file or would cause a risk to the
safety or security to the person required to file or to any other person.
b.
The parish attorney shall evaluate each such request, and shall consider the following factors in such evaluation:

whether the item is privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure by any applicable law or judicial
precedent;
2.
whether the item is of a highly personal nature;

person(s); and

Sec. 23-274. - Annuity reserve fund
The annuity reserve fund shall be the fund in which shall be held the reserves on all annuities in force and from
which shall be paid all annuities and all benefits in lieu of annuities, payable as provided in this division. Should
a beneficiary retired on account of disability be restored to active service his annuity reserve shall be transferred

(Ord. No. 11027, § 8(2), 1-18-73)</p>
<h5 id="_83"></h5>
<p>(a)
The pension accumulation fund shall be the fund in which shall be accumulated all reserves for the payment of
all pensions and other benefits payable from contributions made by employers. Contributions to and payments
from the pension accumulation fund shall be made as follows;
(b)
On the basis of regular interest and of such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the board of
trustees, the actuary engaged by the board to make each valuation required by this division during the period
over which the accrued liability contribution is payable, immediately after making such valuation, shall
determine the uniform and constant percentage of the earnable compensation of the average new entrant, which
if contributed on the basis of compensation of such new entrant throughout the entire period of active service
would be sufficient to provide for the payment of any pension payable on his account. The rate per centum so
determined shall be known as the "normal contribution" rate. After the accrued liability contribution has ceased
to be payable, the normal contribution rate shall be the rate per centum of the earnable salary of all members
obtained by deducting from the total liabilities of the pension accumulation fund the amount of the funds in hand
to the credit of that fund and dividing the remainder by one (1) per centum of the present value of the
prospective future salaries of all members as computed on the basis of the mortality and service tables adopted
by the board of trustees and regular interest. The normal rate of contribution shall be determined by the actuary
after each valuation.
(c)
Immediately succeeding the first valuation the actuary engaged by the board of trustees shall compute the rate
per centum of the total annual compensation of all members which is necessary to liquidate the amount of the
total pension liability on account of all members and beneficiaries which is not dischargeable by the aforesaid
normal contribution made on account of such members during the remainder of their active service. The rate per
centum originally so determined shall be known as the "accrued liability contribution" rate.
(d)
The rate payable to the pension accumulation fund shall be the same as the rate contributed by members as set
forth in section 23-273(b) of this division. Beginning in 1975 the employer's contribution rate shall be five and
eighty-five hundredths (5.85) per centum of total salary and annually thereafter shall be the same rate as that
fixed for employees' contribution as provided in section 23-273(b) hereof. The employer's contribution shall be
forwarded to the board of trustees twice monthly, no later than ten (10) days following each pay period.
(e)
During the period between January 1, 1973 and January 1, 1975, pending completion of the cancellation of the
Social Security agreement; the Jefferson Parish Council shall appropriate and pay to the retirement fund an
amount sufficient to meet the monthly retirement payroll under this supplementary plan and shall also pay such
other expenses of the plan as may be necessary for its administration. Upon completion of the cancellation of the
Social Security agreement and the receipt of employee and employer contributions by the fund beginning
January 1, 1975, the council shall cease such appropriation and the payments shall be made from the funds of the
retirement plan.
(f)
Upon the retirement of a member an amount equal to his annuity reserve shall be transferred from the pension
accumulation fund to the annuity reserve fund.
(g)
The board of trustees may transfer annually from the pension accumulation fund to the expense fund an amount
sufficient to cover the expenses of the system.

fiscal year.
(2)
Any surplus in excess of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) existing at the end of any fiscal year in the expense

period subsequent to the date of establishment of the retirement system the contributions payable by such
member, as provided in this division in section 23-273(b). The Finance Director of Jefferson Parish shall certify
to the secretary-manager of this retirement system on each and every payroll, the amounts so deducted.
(b)
The collection of employers' contribution, if and when assessed or required, shall be as follows:
(1)
Upon the basis of each actuarial valuation provided herein, the board of trustees shall annually prepare a
statement of the total amount necessary for the ensuing fiscal year to the pension accumulation and expense
