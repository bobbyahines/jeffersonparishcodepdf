<h5 id="sec-27-51-adjustment-of-charges">Sec. 27-51. - Adjustment of charges.</h5>
<p>(a)
A parish utility consumer is entitled to have the water and sewer charges adjusted no more than once in a twelvemonth period as outlined in the following:
(1)
Increase due to leak or act of vandal. A parish utility consumer's water and sewerage charges can be adjusted if
the increase in charges is directly identified to a leak in the consumer's water system or damage caused by an act
of a vandal which caused a waste of water, an increase in water consumption.
(2)
Historical average consumption.
a.
For adjustment affecting the sewerage system, the adjustment of the parish utility, consumer's water and
sewerage charges be recalculated using the historical average consumption of the consumer's account plus onehalf (½) of the excessive consumption. For example, the average consumption is subtracted from the
consumption of the bill that is to be adjusted. The difference between the average consumption and the
consumption that is being questioned will be referred to as unadjusted consumption. The unadjusted
consumption is divided into two (2) equal amounts. The parish departments of water and sewerage will add one
(1) part to the average consumption and refer to this figure as the adjusted consumption. The charges for
sewerage and water are then recalculated using the adjusted consumption. The difference between the charges
for sewage and water on the original bill and the charges generated using the adjusted consumption is to be the
dollar value of the adjustment to the consumer;
b.
For adjustment not affecting the sewer system, the adjustment of the parish utility consumer's sewerage charge
shall be recalculated by using the historical average consumption of the consumer's account only. The difference
between the charges for sewerage on the original bill and the charges generated using the historical average
consumption is to be the dollar value of the adjustment to the consumer. The adjustment for water will remain as
established in subsection (a).
(3)
Repairs required. The parish departments of water and sewerage may require, prior to adjusting a consumer's
bill, that the necessary repairs to their system be made. The parish departments of water and sewerage should be
satisfied that a leak did exist and has been repaired. This may be accomplished by inspection which would verify
a leak existed and the repairs made or a signed affidavit be executed by the consumer to this effect and/or a copy
of a plumber's invoice that the leak was repaired.
(b)
Increase due to a catastrophic event. A parish utility consumer's water and sewerage charges can be adjusted if
the increase in the charge is directly identified to be damage caused by a catastrophic event.
A catastrophic event occurs when the Jefferson Parish President declares a state of emergency pursuant to the
Louisiana Homeland Security and Emergency Assistance and Disaster Act as defined in R.S. 29:721 et seq.
After a state of emergency is declared, the director of water must request from the Jefferson Parish Council, the
authority to adjust utility bills on a case by case basis if the adjustment is directly identified to be damages
caused by the catastrophic event. The director of water may restructure, reduce or waive the consumer's water
consumption and sewer user fees on a case by case basis, up to and including the complete waiver of fees for a
given period following a catastrophic event, if such waiver is warranted by the facts of the case as presented to
the director. Persons wishing to contest any such decision of the director of water may appeal the director's
decision directly to the Jefferson Parish Council. In such cases, the decision of the council regarding the
adjustment of the utility bill shall be final.

<p>(a)
Policy statement.
(1)
The sanitary sewerage system exists to provide for the collection of polluted wastewater from public and private
property and its treatment through normal sewage treatment practices. It is in the public interest that reasonable
rules and regulations be applied to discharges into the sanitary sewerage systems to prevent the system from
being unnecessarily or excessively burdened, and to ensure that effluent from the sanitary sewerage system will
comply with all applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations.
(2)
Proper operation of the sanitary sewerage system requires, among other things, the prohibition of any discharge
components which would not be compatible with, or which would be harmful to or would interfere with the
system. Proper operation of the system also requires that the system not be burdened with storm water runoff
and similar wastewater which should be discharged through the storm drainage system. Safe operation of the
system also requires that discharges of toxic substances and other harmful materials into the system be
prohibited.
(b)
General prohibitions and limitations. No person shall cause or permit any discharge into the sanitary sewerage
system containing any pollutant or other material of such character or quality that will:
(1)
Not be susceptible to or compatible with treatment by the system, or interfere with or damage the system or its
efficient operation thereof;
(2)
Constitute a hazard to human life, or to the stream or watercourse receiving the effluent;
(3)
Violate any pretreatment standard or effluent limitation as defined herein;
(4)
Cause the system to violate any applicable LPDES permit or any applicable water quality standard;
(5)
Violate any of the specific prohibitions or limitations established by subsection (c) of this section;

The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the industrial disposal premises outside the
building. When such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the director may allow
a facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, with the approval of the public agency having
jurisdiction over such street or sidewalk, and located so that it will not be obstructed by public utilities,
landscaping or parked vehicles. All sampling ports shall be constructed above ground and not subject to any
ground or rain water infiltration or dilution. All manholes shall be leak-proof and not subject to any ground or
rain water infiltration or dilution;
(3)
When the discharge from an individual discharger enters the parish sewerage system at more than one (1)
location, the director may require said discharger to provide current discharge rates occurring at each discharge
point. Such discharge rates, expressed as a percentage of the total flow, shall be established by measurement or
approved estimate;
(4)
When more than one (1) discharger can discharge into a common sewer, the director may require installation of
separate monitoring equipment for each. When there is a significant difference in wastewater characteristics
produced by different operations of a single discharger, the director may require that separate monitoring
facilities be installed for each separate operation.
(5)
Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance
with the director's requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
(d)
Frequency of monitoring. The director shall require each significant discharger to monitor his discharge and
report the results of such monitoring at specified intervals. For industrial dischargers not categorized as
significant, the director may establish a self-monitoring and reporting schedule, as deemed appropriate for that
industry and the characteristics of its discharge.
(e)
Pollutants to be monitored. The director shall provide to each discharger who is determined to require selfmonitoring a complete list of wastewater constituents for which the discharger must provide monitoring. The
director shall provide to the discharger information regarding discharge prohibitions and limitations for
pollutants to be self-monitored.
(f)
Inspection, sampling and analysis.
(1)
Compliance determination. Compliance determinations with respect to section 27-146 prohibitions and
limitations may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of wastewater.
Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-four-hour period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as
determined necessary by the director to meet the needs of specific circumstances. All sampling shall be
conducted in accordance with the methods described in 40 CFR 136;
(2)
Analysis of industrial wastewaters. Laboratory analyses of industrial wastewater samples shall be performed in
accordance with the procedures described in 40 CFR 136. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques,
to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance
with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an
applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the 40 CFR Part 136 sampling and
analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be performed
using validated analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the control authority or other parties
approved by the EPA. If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in 27-149(a) of this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more frequently than required by the
control authority, using the procedures prescribed in this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included
in the report.
(3)
[Reserved.]
(g)
Reporting of accidental discharges. If, for any reason, a discharger does not comply with any prohibition or
limitations in this division, the discharger shall immediately notify the director so that corrective action may be
taken to protect the sanitary sewerage system. In addition, a written report addressed to the director detailing the
date, time and cause of the accidental discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the discharge within five (5)
days of the occurrence of the noncompliance.
(h)
Record-keeping requirements.
(1)
Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall maintain records of all
information resulting from any monitoring activities required by this section. Such records shall include for all
samples:
(i)
The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling and the names of the person or persons taking the samples;
(ii)
The dates analyses were performed;
(iii)
Who performed the analyses;
(iv)
The analytical techniques/methods use; and
(v)
The results of such analyses.
(2)
Any industrial user subject to the reporting requirements established in this section shall be required to retain for
a minimum of three (3) years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not such monitoring
activities are required by this section) and shall make such records available for inspection and copying by the
director. This period of retention shall be extended during the course of an unresolved litigation regarding the
industrial user or POTW or when requested by the director.

division;
(6)
For waste discharges defined as hazardous or toxic by EPA, the director may require the discharge to be halted
and the discharger to verify in writing that the hazardous/toxic waste components are being stored, treated and/or
disposed in full compliance with EPA and Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality regulations.
(b)
Admission to property.
(1)
The director shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying
with all requirements of this ordinance and any individual wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder. Users shall allow the director ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
a.
Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into
its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of
suitable identification, the director shall be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing
specific responsibilities.
b.
The director shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.

e.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the director access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this ordinance.
(c)
Confidentiality. Information and data regarding industrial discharges including reports, questionnaires, permit
applications, permits, monitoring programs, and inspections will be available to the public or another
government agency unless nondisclosure is requested in writing and such information is determined by the
parish to require confidentiality. Industries that request confidentiality must demonstrate that the release of such
data would divulge information, processes, or methods of production that would be entitled to protection
pursuant to the law of the State of Louisiana. Such information may be classified as confidential by the
department if the director makes a written determination that confidentiality is necessary to protect trade secrets,
proprietary secrets and information, and commercial or financial information.
Requests for confidentiality must be made at the time the material is received by the Parish of Jefferson, and the
word "confidential" should appear prominently on each page. Permit applications or permit modification
documents shall contain references in the applicable sections to the pages wherein a confidentiality request has
been made. Anyone requesting confidentiality must provide to the parish a statement setting forth the reasons
and authority for the designation. If no confidentiality claim is made at the time of submission, the parish may
make the information available to the public without further notice at least to the extent provided by 40 CFR
2.302. If a claim is asserted, the information will be treated in accordance with procedures in which the fullest
possible disclosure of records to the public consistent with the rights of individuals to privacy and the rights of
persons in business information entitled to confidential treatment will be made. If the director determines that
any material should not be afforded confidentiality, the director shall issue a written denial of the request for
nondisclosure to the requestor. Nondisclosure shall not apply to necessary use by duly authorized officers or
employees of parish, state or federal government in carrying out their responsibilities under local, state or federal
law. Any officer or employee of the local, state or federal government who seeks access to such information
must be duly authorized by the director. The director shall make the determination to grant such authorization
based on a request by such person. The director may request in writing the requestor's name affiliation, and the
need for access to the information based on applicable local, state or federal law.</p>
<p>Air-emission data, effluent data, discharges to surface water and groundwater and the location and identification
of any buried waste materials shall not be construed as confidential information. Claims of confidentiality for the
name and address of any permit applicant or permittee will be denied.
Access to confidential information will be provided only to the director, and representatives of the parish, state
or federal government in carrying out their responsibilities under state or federal law.
The director may declare documents, records, information, or other items confidential in order to prevent
impairment of an ongoing investigation or prejudice to the final decision regarding a violation.
Information determined to be confidential by the director shall be maintained in a locked file separate from
nonconfidential information. The file shall be labeled "CONFIDENTIAL," with access appropriately controlled.
Whenever a person is authorized access to a confidential file, he shall sign an access log which indicates his
understanding of the confidential status and his responsibility to protect the information from being disclosed to
the public. The person will also indicate in the access log which file was removed, the date and time the file was
removed, his affiliation, and the time and date the file was returned. Except for the staff of the parish department
of environmental affairs, authorized persons shall review a confidential file in the presence of a department of
environmental affairs staff member.
The release of nonconfidential information to the public or another governmental agency will be accomplished
only with the written approval of the parish attorney. Such requests must be made in writing to the parish
attorney at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance of the desired date of release of information. In order to
avoid a possible misfiling of the records, public access to the files will not be permitted. The requested
nonconfidential materials will be photocopied and presented to the individuals requesting the information at
their cost.
(d)
The parish reserves the right to deny discharge or impose conditions on any new or increased discharge to the
POTW if it may adversely affect POTW operation, worker safety, or compliance with state and/or federal
regulations.
(e)
The parish may require the submission of a slug or spill control and countermeasure plan for those industrial
users who may cause or have caused problems to the POTW with slug discharges or spills.

Public participation requirements of 40 CFR Part 25 in CFR in the enforcement of pretreatment standards. In
accordance with 40 CFR 403.8(f)(2)(viii), the parish must publish, at least annually, in a newspaper of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW a list of
industrial users which, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards or other pretreatment requirements. For the purposes of this provision, a
significant industrial user (or any industrial user that violates LAC 33:IX.6115.F.2.h.iii, iv, or v) is in "significant
noncompliance" if its violation meets one (1) or more of the following criteria: (i) Chronic violations of
wastewater discharge limits, defined here as those in which sixty-six (66) percent or more of all of the
measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a
numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40 CFR 403.3(1);
(ii) technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in which thirty-three (33) percent or more of
all of the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter during a six-month period equal or exceed the
product of the numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as defined by 40
CFR 403.3(1) multiplied by the applicable TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oil, and grease, and 1.2 for all
other pollutants except pH); (iii) any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as defined by 40
CFR 403.3(1) (daily maximum, long term-average, instantaneous limit, or narrative standard) that the control
authority determines has caused, alone or in combination with other discharges, interference or pass through
(including endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public); (iv) any discharge of a pollutant
that has caused imminent endangerment to human health or welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the
POTW's exercise of its emergency authority under LAC 33:IX.6115. F.1.g.ii. to halt or prevent such a discharge;
(v) failure to meet within ninety (90) days after the schedule date, a compliance schedule milestone contained in
a local control mechanism or enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or attaining
final compliance; (vi) failure to provide, within forty-five (45) days after the due date, required reports such as
baseline monitoring reports, ninety-day compliance reports, periodic self monitoring reports, and reports on
compliance with compliance schedules; (vii) failure to accurately report noncompliance; and (viii) any other
violation or group of violations, which may include a violation of best management practices, that the control
authority determines will adversely affect the operation or implementation of the pretreatment program of
Jefferson Parish.
(b)

subsection (c). He may also issue notice of termination of service in accordance with subsection (d) of this
section.
(2)
Any compliance order issued under this subsection shall be sent by certified mail, addressed to the principal
place of business in Jefferson Parish, state with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation, and specify a
time for compliance, which the director determines is reasonable taking into account the seriousness of the
violation and any good faith efforts to comply with applicable requirements. The order shall also provide an
opportunity for the person to whom it is directed to confer with the director concerning the alleged violation.
(c)
Civil action. The director and/or parish attorney is authorized to commence a civil action for appropriate relief,
including a permanent or temporary injunction, for any violation for which the director is authorized to issue a
compliance order under subsection (a) of this section.
(d)
Termination of service. The director may take action to terminate service to any person for any violation for
which he is authorized to issue a compliance order under subsection (a) of this section. The procedure for
termination of service shall be as follows:
(1)
Revocation of permit and termination of service. Prior to the suspension or revocation of a permit and the
termination of public works services, the director shall notify the holder of the permit in writing. Said notice
shall advise that the parish will consider the suspension or revocation of the permit, termination of service or
disconnection. Said notice shall state the date of proposed suspension or revocation, termination of service and
proposed disconnection of service, the reason therefore, and the time, date and place that the director shall hold a
hearing upon the proposed suspension or revocation, termination or disconnection. Such hearing shall not be less
than ten (10) days subsequent to the receipt of notice. Said notice shall be mailed to the owner at the address
shown on the permit application or as known to the department. A copy may be delivered to the permit holder or
the person in charge of the facility or posted conspicuously on the property affected. The parish may (but shall
not be required to) give such further additional notice as in the discretion of the director or parish attorney is
convenient or desirable. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the director shall determine whether grounds exist for
suspension or revocation, for termination and/or for disconnection of service. If such grounds are found to exist,
the permit shall forthwith be suspended or revoked and service shall forthwith be terminated and sanitary and
waste disposal and water facilities forthwith disconnected. A copy of said decision shall be sent by certified mail
to the owner at the address shown on the permit or as known to the director, and a copy shall be delivered to the
facility or posted conspicuously on the property. The service of said copy of the decision shall not be a condition
precedent or subsequent to suspension or revocation, termination or disconnection.
(e)
Restoration of service. Any person whose permit has been suspended or revoked, or for whom service has been
terminated or disconnected, may petition the director for reinstatement of the permit and reinstatement of
service.
(1)
Such petition shall be verified under the oath or declaration under penalty of perjury of the person petitioning.
The petition shall contain a detailed statement of the corrective action taken by the petitioner or others to remove
the grounds for suspension or revocation, termination or disconnection, and of the corrective measures to
prevent a repetition of the violation. The petition shall contain the name and address of the petitioner for
purposes of receiving notice.
(2)
Said petition shall be filed with the director. Said petition shall be heard within thirty-five (35) days of the date
of receipt by the director. A written notice of time, date and place of hearing shall be given to the petitioner at
least ten (10) days before the hearing in writing by certified mail to the petitioner at the address shown on the
petition. The petitioner may waive the notice in writing. At the hearing, the director shall consider evidence
presented by the petitioner in support of his petition and evidence in opposition. The director may restore the
permit, service and connection if he finds that the grounds for suspension, revocation, termination and
disconnection have been corrected, and that there is adequate assurance of corrective measures to prevent a
repetition of the offense for which the permit was suspended or revoked and service terminated or disconnected,
or for any other reason deemed appropriate.
(3)
The director may, as a condition to the restoration of the permit, service and connection:
a.
Require the petitioner to provide reasonable safeguards and security to avoid a repetition of the offense for
which the permit was suspended, revoked and service terminated and disconnected;
b.
Impose reasonable charges to compensate the parish for expenses incurred in connection with the suspension or
revocation, termination or disconnection and in connection with the reinstatement of the permit and the
restoration of service;
c.
Make such other reasonable conditions as are necessary to protect public health, safety and property, and to
prevent a nuisance;
d.
Take such other action as may be necessary and proper.
(f)

<p>All food service operations shall install, at their own expense, a grease control device of the size and type
specified by the director of code enforcement as required. Compliance with this section will be required by the
FSO discharging fats, oil or grease into the sewerage system regardless of whether that discharger is the owner
or lessee of a property. There will be a grace period to allow FSOs to come into compliance. No enforcement
action will be taken for six (6) months after adoption of this ordinance by the parish council. Specifically, those
FSOs required to have grease control devices shall comply with the following provisions:
(1)
General provisions:
a.
All grease control devices shall be kept free of inorganic solid material such as grit, rocks, gravel, sand, eating
utensils, cigarettes, shells, towels, rags, etc., which could inhibit the design performance of the grease control
device;
b.
All FSOs are required to maintain their grease control device in good working order and in accordance with any
manufacturer's specifications;
c.
After twelve (12) months of documented compliance with this section, an FSO may appeal to the director of the
department of environmental affairs to reduce the cleaning frequency of its grease control device;
d.
All food service operations shall operate grease control devices in a manner such that the discharge limit
specified in section 27-146(c)2.a is consistently achieved. "Consistent" shall mean that any wastewater sample
taken from the grease control device effluent will contain fats, oil or grease in concentrations no greater than
those specified in section 27-146(c)2.a.
1.
The parish reserves the right to collect samples at any time during normal business hours to verify compliance
with section 27-146 and reserves the right to require an FSO to collect and analyze samples at their own
expense. Prior to collecting samples, the department of environmental affairs must approve the sampling time,
location, and analytes. Right of entry shall be provided during normal business hours for the purpose of sample
collection or inspection. Copies of analytical results shall be mailed by FSO to the parish within two (2) weeks
of receipt of results with a cover letter certifying that the FSO acknowledges the analytical results;
2.
In the event that additional techniques are required to verify compliance, including but not limited to remote
sewer line inspection, the cost for these techniques shall be borne by the food service operation if he is found to
be out of compliance;
e.
Grease, wastewater, and/or solids removed from a grease control device and treated on or off-site shall not be
reintroduced into the grease control device;
f.
Under no circumstances shall grease, wastewater and/or sludge removed from a grease control device be
introduced into the sanitary sewer system or storm drainage system;
g
The use of additives, i.e. bacteria, chemical additives, (including but not limited to acids, bleach, etc.), or
enzymes, the sole purpose of which is to remove fats, oil, or grease from the grease control device is strictly
prohibited. Removal of accumulated fats, oil or grease shall only be accomplished through physical or
mechanical methods.
(2)
Grease traps:
a.
For grease traps, remove, at the users expense, the entire contents of the grease trap, including any accumulated
grease layer, wastewater, and solids, as often as required to comply with the provisions of section 27-146(c)2.a
but at intervals of not longer than thirty (30) days;
b.
All FSOs shall maintain on the premises one (1) year of records, including the current FSO discharge permit and
completed fats, oil or grease manifest forms that document the cleaning of grease traps in accordance with this
section. Manifests shall be provided by the permitted fats, oil or grease waste hauler at the time of cleaning. All
such records shall be available for inspection by the parish during normal business hours.
(3)
Above ground fats, oil or grease interceptors: Establishments using above ground fats, oil or grease interceptors
that must be manually cleaned shall maintain local records, for a period of one (1) year, reflecting the cleaning of
the fats, oil or grease interceptor. Each fats, oil or grease interceptor must be cleaned at a minimum of once
every seven (7) days of operation. The local records will contain the name, printed, of the person cleaning the
fats, oil or grease interceptor, the date of cleaning, the time of cleaning and disposal method, and the signature of
the cleaner verifying completion. Fats, oil or grease removed from such a device will be disposed of properly.
(4)
Grease removal devices: Should a food service operation be approved by the director of code enforcement to use
a grease removal device (GRD), it is required to obtain a maintenance and service contract with a qualified
service provider to render maintenance and inspection of the GRD in accordance with manufacturer's
recommendations and specifications. The establishment must maintain a copy of its maintenance contract on-site
and provide a copy to the director of the department of environmental affairs. Also, the establishment must
maintain inspection and servicing documents for the GRD for a period of one (1) year.
(5)
Enforcement:
a.
Failure to comply with any of the above provisions or with the permit conditions will result in a maximum fine
of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or a maximum of thirty (30) days imprisonment or both. Each day of a
violation shall be treated as a separate offense. Federal offenses for violation of the Clean Water Act will be
considered, if appropriate, and forwarded on to the responsible federal agency for prosecution. The provisions
for issuance of a compliance order in section 27-151(b) and termination of service in section 27-151(d) also
apply;
b.
The administrative adjudication hearing officer shall have the authority to enforce the requirements of this
ordinance, as stipulated in Chapter 2.5, section 2.54 of this Code. An official of the administrative adjudication
bureau shall be authorized to post a violation notice at the main business entrance of a violator's establishment,
indicating the nature of the violation occurring on the premises. Such a notice can only be removed by an
authorized Jefferson Parish official. Removal of such a sign by any other party will itself be considered a
violation, and the presumption will be made in favor of the parish that it was removed by an authorized agent of
the violator. The environmental affairs department shall have the authority to notify the Jefferson Parish Water
Department to terminate water services to violators of this article.
c.
None of the penalties listed in section 27-152 exclude or supersede the penalties provided by state and federal
law.

Q t = Total metered water consumption per billing period in thousands of gallons.
P = Product usage per billing period in thousands of gallons, as established by the discharger to the satisfaction
of the director. Where the discharger fails to so establish its product usage, the value of P shall be zero. It shall
be the duty of the discharger to submit such records, which shall be accurate and complete, to the director as he
may require, to enable the director to properly assess the charge.
C v = Amount charged based on volume of water consumed.
(2)
Food service operation volume charge. All food service operations as defined in section 27-143 discharging into
the sanitary sewerage system shall be assessed a volume rate charge based on seventy-five (75) percent of total
metered water consumption, as indicated by the water meter reading, at a rate of one dollar ($1.00) per [one]
thousand gallons. The formula for computing the volume charge shall be:
Q t × Rate (as established above) = C v
Where:
Q t = Total metered water consumption per billing period in thousands of gallons.
Q v = Amount charged based on volume of water consumed.
(e)</p>
<p>Excessive strength charge (ESC). This charge is an additional sewerage service charge levied on all industrial
users, excluding food service operations, who discharge into the sanitary sewerage system any waste of higher
strength than that of domestic sewerage as defined in section 27-143 and is intended to defray the added cost of
treating higher strength waste. ESC shall be calculated based on excessive BOD and excessive TSS. In those
instances where the wastewater discharger has a COD concentration greater than or equal to two and one-half
(2.50) times that of the BOD concentration, the ESC shall be calculated based on the excessive COD. The
director may require the discharger to provide data demonstrating the treatability of such wastewater. The ESC
shall be computed according to the following formula:
ESC = (V - P) × 0.00834 × [a(BOD - 500) + b(TSS - 250)]
Alternatively, if COD is greater than or equal to 2.5 times BOD ESC = (V - P) × 0.00834 × [a(COD - 500 +
b(TSS - 250)]
Where:
V = Metered water volume per billing period in thousands of gallons
P = Product usage per billing period in thousands of gallons
0.00834 = Constant to convert milligrams per liter to pounds per thousand gallons
200 = Milligrams per liter of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) allowed in wastewater with no excessive
strength charge
250 = Milligrams per liter of total suspended solids (TSS) allowed in wastewater with no excessive strength
charge
500 = Milligrams per liter of chemical oxygen demand (COD) allowed in wastewater with no excessive
strength charge
a = Unit cost of treatment per pound of BOD and COD
b = Unit cost of treatment per pound of TSS
BOD = Concentration of BOD in discharger's waste effluent, expressed in mg/l
TSS = Concentration of TSS in discharger's waste effluent, expressed in mg/l
COD = Concentration of COD in discharger's waste effluent, expressed in mg/l
(1)
All required sampling for the determination of ESC shall be done in accordance with section 27-152.2.
(2)
If an industrial user has a wastewater discharge permit, provisions regarding ESC, including, but not limited to,
sampling location and monitoring frequency, stated in their wastewater discharge permit take precedence.
(3)
Excessive strength charges (ESC) for industrial users classified by the 1987 Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) Manual, published by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, as SIC Code 2086 that are primarily
engaged in the manufacturing of bottled and canned soft drinks and carbonated waters shall be computed
according to the following formula:
ESC = (V - P) × 0.00834 × [c(BOD - 200) + b(TSS - 250)]
Where:
c = the current charge
the terms V, P, BOD, b and TSS are defined in section 27-152(e).
The base charge for a, b and c will be adjusted annually beginning January 1, 2002, based on the percentage
change in the Consumer Price Index. The annual adjustment will equal a U.S. City Average 12 month percentage
change in the All Urban Consumers—All Items Index (CPI-U) as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
The CPI adjusted charges are published annually in the Official Journal of Jefferson Parish and in the
Progressive Jefferson, the publication ordinarily accompanying the water bills themselves.
(f)
Monitoring and surveillance fee, food service operations.
(1)
All food service operations, regardless of the type of grease control device installed, are required to obtain an
annual discharge permit or permit renewal through the department of environmental affairs and shall comply
with all provisions of the permit. Permits are not transferable. A monitoring and surveillance fee not to exceed
three hundred dollars ($300.00) per year per FSO shall be assessed during the processing of the permit or permit
renewal in order to recoup the costs of administering this program including but not limited to time and
materials spent assigning permits and inspecting FSOs. The following food service operations shall be exempt
from the monitoring and surveillance fee:
a.
Schools, kindergarten through 12th grade, including public, private, and parochial;
b.
Day care facilities;
c.
Churches, religious institutions, and not-for-profit food distribution centers such as homeless shelters;
d.
Not for profit nursing homes.
(2)
Exemption. If, in the opinion of the director of the department of environmental affairs, a food service operation
does not discharge fats, oil or grease during the conduct of business, an exemption to the monitoring and
surveillance fee may be issued. However, this does not exempt the user from the requirement to obtain a
discharge permit under section 27-152. At least one (1) time per year and no later than September 30th of a
given year, the director of the department of sewerage shall submit to the director of public works an estimate of
the costs incurred in clearing blockages caused by fats, oil or grease in the sewerage collection system for the
last twelve-month period.

<p>(a)
Assessment of ESC may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or composite samples of
wastewater, as determined by the director. ESC shall be determined using an average value for each relevant
parameter. This average shall be determined using all acceptable data, both self-monitoring and parish
monitoring, available, on a quarterly basis, at the time of billing. The director shall determine the acceptability of
data.
(b)
Samples must be collected during normal business operating hours and must be representative of typical
wastewater discharge from a facility. The facility must wait at least five (5) days after maintenance of any
pretreatment device before sample collection may occur.
(c)
All sampling and analysis shall be conducted in accordance with the methods described in 40 CFR 136.
(d)
All analytical results must be submitted on the "Industrial User Self-Monitoring Report" form. The department
of environmental affairs will provide these forms as requested.
(e)
If an industrial user monitors any parameter at the designated sampling location more frequently than required,
using test procedures approved under 40 CFR Part 136, the results of this monitoring shall be reported within
two (2) weeks of receipt of results to the Jefferson Parish Department of Environmental Affairs.
(f)
The director shall establish the discharge location where the ESC is to be assessed and all sampling required for
determining ESC shall take place at this location. If, in the opinion of the director, a suitable sampling port is not
present, the industrial user shall install, at his own expense, such a port.
(g)
The parish may, at any time, collect samples of the discharge from an industrial user to assess the validity of
established surcharge parameter values and/or to determine compliance with local limits defined in subdivision.
If samples results indicate a significant deviation from previously established surcharge parameter values, those
results may be used to modify the ESC in order to reflect prevailing conditions. If sample results indicate an
exceedance of any local limit, the director may require the facility to take whatever action is deemed necessary
to bring the facility into compliance.

Prohibitions and limitations on discharges into the sanitary sewerage system.
(1)
Policy statement.
a.
The sanitary sewerage system exists to provide for the collection of polluted wastewater from public and private
property and its treatment through normal sewage treatment practices. It is in the public interest that reasonable
rules and regulations be applied to discharges into the sanitary sewerage system to prevent the system from
being unnecessarily or excessively burdened, and to insure that effluent from the sanitary sewerage system will
comply with all applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations;
b.
Proper operation of the sanitary sewerage system requires, among other things, the prohibition of any discharge
components which would not be compatible with, or which would be harmful to, or would interfere with the
system. Proper operation of the system also requires that the system not be burdened with stormwater and
similar wastewater which should be discharged into the storm drainage system. Safe operation of the system also
requires that discharges of toxic substances and other harmful materials into the system be prohibited.
(2)
General prohibitions and limitations. No person shall cause or permit any discharge into the sanitary sewerage
system containing any pollutant or other material of such character or quality that will:
a.
Not be susceptible to or compatible with treatment by the system, or interfere with or damage the system or its
efficient operation thereof;
b.
Constitute a hazard to human life, or to the stream or water course receiving the effluent;
c.
Violate any effluent limitation as defined herein;
d.
Cause the system to violate any applicable NPDES or LWDPS permit or any applicable water quality standard;

regarding the mobile waste hauler or POTW or when requested by the director.
(h)</p>
<p>Fees. The mobile waste haulers shall be assessed the following rates for discharging wastewater into the
Jefferson Parish Sanitary Sewerage System. The following rates are established to enable the parish to recover
the costs associated with receiving and treating the wastes from mobile waste haulers.
(1)
Low solids domestic wastewater rate is applicable to wastes brought in from holding tanks, and other tanks
"used primarily for storing the sanitary wastewater." Holding tanks emptied at least once/month, excluding
portable chemical toilets, are considered to be "used primarily for storing the sanitary wastewater" for the
purpose of this section. Rate: Five cents ($0.05) per gallon.
(2)
High solids domestic wastewater rate is applicable to wastes brought in from septic tanks and other tanks "used
for treating the sanitary wastewater." These tanks, if functioning properly, generally require emptying at
frequencies much less than once per month. Wastewater from portable chemical toilets, regardless of how often
they are emptied, is included in this category due to its high solids content. Rate: Twenty cents ($0.20) per
gallon.
(3)
Assessment of charges shall be based on total volume of the truck.
(4)
Mixed loads of high solids domestic wastewater and low solids domestic wastewater will not be accepted. Each
truckload must contain only one (1) type of waste.
(5)
The parish shall review these rates from time to time and revise the rates, if necessary, to recover the costs
associated with receiving and treating the wastes from mobile waste haulers.
(i)
Control of prohibited wastes; powers and duties of director.
(1)
Regulatory actions. If wastewater is discharged, or proposed to be discharged, in violation of this section, the
director and/or the parish attorney may take such action necessary to:
a.
Prohibit the discharge;
b.
Require the person making, causing or allowing the discharge to pay any additional cost or expense or damages
incurred by the parish for handling and treating excess loads imposed on the sanitary sewerage system;
c.
Take such other remedial action as may be deemed to be desirable or necessary to achieve the purpose of this
section.
(j)
Enforcement.

be, in violation of this section, or of any condition of a permit issued under this section, he may issue a
compliance order in accordance with this subsection, or he may bring a civil action in accordance with this
subsection (1). He may also suspend or revoke the wastewater discharge permit.
b.
Any compliance order issued under this subsection shall be sent by certified mail, addressed to the principal
place of business in Jefferson Parish, state with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation, and specify a
time for compliance, which the director determines is reasonable taking into account the seriousness of the
violation, and any good faith efforts to comply with applicable requirements. The order shall also provide an
opportunity for the person to whom it is directed to confer with the director concerning the alleged violation.
(2)
Civil action. The director and/or parish attorney is authorized to commence a civil action for appropriate relief,
including a permanent or temporary injunction, for any violation for which the director is authorized to issue a
compliance order under subsection (1).
(3)
Suspension or revocation of permit. The director may take action to suspend or revoke a wastewater discharge
permit to any person for any violation for which he is authorized to issue a compliance order under subsection
(1). The procedures for permit suspension or revocation shall be as follows:
a.

landscaping or parked vehicle. All sampling ports shall be constructed above ground and not subject to any
groundwater or rainwater infiltration or dilution.
(3)
When more than one (1) discharger can discharge into a common sewer, the director may require installation of
separate monitoring equipment for each. When there is a significant difference in wastewater characteristics
produced by different operations of a single discharger, the director may require that separate monitoring
facilities be installed for each separate operation.
(4)
Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance
with the director's requirements and all applicable construction standards and specifications.
(d)
Frequency of monitoring: The director may require a discharger to monitor his discharge and report the results
of the monitoring at specified intervals.
(e)
Pollutants to be monitored: The director shall provide to each discharger who is determined to require selfmonitoring a complete list of wastewater constituents for which the discharger must provide monitoring. The
director shall provide information regarding discharge prohibitions and limitations for pollutants to be selfmonitored.
(f)
Inspection; sampling and analysis:
(1)
Compliance determinations: Compliance determinations with respect to section 27-161 prohibitions and

Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-four-hour period, or over a longer or shorter time span, as
determined necessary by the director to meet the needs of specific circumstances.
(2)</p>
<p>Analysis of industrial wastewaters: Laboratory analysis of industrial wastewater samples shall be performed in
accordance with the current edition of Standard Methods or other procedures approved by the director.
(g)
Reporting of accidental discharges: If, for any reason, a discharger does not comply with any prohibition or
limitation in this division, the discharger shall immediately notify the director so that corrective action may be
taken to protect the storm drainage system. In addition, a written report addressed to the director detailing the
date, time and cause of the accidental discharge, the quantity and characteristics of the discharge, and corrective
action shall be filed by the discharger within five (5) days of the occurrence of the noncompliance.

holder of the permit in writing. This notice shall advise that the parish will consider the suspension or revocation
of the permit, termination of service or disconnection. The notice shall state the date of proposed suspension or
revocation, termination of service, and disconnection of service, the reason therefor, and the time, date and place
that the director shall hold a hearing upon the proposed suspension or revocation, termination or disconnection.

delivered to the permit holder or the person in charge of the facility or posted conspicuously on the property
affected. The parish may (but shall not be required to) give such further additional notice as in the discretion of
the director or parish attorney is convenient or desirable. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the director shall
determine whether grounds exist for suspension or revocation, for termination and/or for disconnection of
service. If such grounds are found to exist, the permit shall forthwith be suspended or revoked and service shall
forthwith be terminated and sanitary and waste disposal and water facilities forthwith disconnected. A copy of
the decision shall be sent by certified mail to the owner at the address shown on the permit or as known to the
director, and a copy shall be delivered to the facility or posted conspicuously on the property. The service of the
copy of the decision shall not be a condition precedent or subsequent to suspension or revocation, termination or
disconnection.
(d)
Restoration of service: Any person whose permit has been suspended or revoked, or for whom service has been
terminated or disconnected, may petition the director for reinstatement of service.
(1)
This petition shall be verified under the oath or declaration under penalty of perjury of the person petitioning.
The petition shall contain a detailed statement of the corrective action taken by the petitioner or others to remove
the grounds for suspension or revocation, termination or disconnection, and of the corrective measures to
prevent a repetition of the violation. The petition shall contain the name and address of the petitioner for
purposes of receiving notice.
(2)
The petition shall be filed with the director. The petition shall be heard within thirty-five (35) days of the date of
receipt by the director. A written notice of time, date and place of hearing shall be given to the petitioner at least
ten (10) days before the hearing by certified mail to the petitioner at the address shown on the petition. The
petitioner may waive the notice. At the hearing, the director shall consider evidence presented by the petitioner
in support of his petition and evidence in opposition. The director may restore the permit, service and connection
if he finds that the grounds for suspension or revocation, termination or disconnection have been corrected, and
that there is adequate assurance of corrective measures to prevent a repetition of the offense for which the permit
was suspended or revoked and service terminated or disconnected, or for any other reason deemed appropriate in
the premises of the director.
(3)
The director may, as a condition to the restoration of the permit, service and connection:
a.
Require the petitioner to provide reasonable safeguards and security to avoid a repetition of the offense for
which the permit was suspended or revoked and service terminated and disconnected;
b.
Impose reasonable charges to compensate the parish for expenses incurred in connection with the suspension or
revocation, termination or disconnection and in connection with the reinstatement of the permit and the

[Reconnection.] In the event that water services are discontinued, services shall be reconnected upon proof of
compliance with the requirements of this code or upon court order and after payment of any fees due the water
department.
(d)
Disconnection. Should it be necessary for an authorized representative to cause water services to be
discontinued, such shall only occur after due notification.
(e)
Notification of disconnection. The authorized representative of the parish must attempt to notify the owner of the
property and the occupants of the property at least ten (10) days, inclusive of weekends and parish holidays,

discontinued, and the approximate hour by which such is anticipated to occur; that the owner/occupant has an
opportunity to dispute the discontinuation by seeking to have an injunction issued against the parish, by a court
of competent jurisdiction; or by contacting an authorized representative of the parish seek an extension, or to
determine whether the property and its occupants fall under one (1) of the exceptions; and the reason(s) why the
property has been determined to constitute an "immediate threat".
(f)
Exception. If there are minor children living on the premises or if there is a sick person living on the premises,
the authorized representatives of the parish may grant an extension before causing the discontinuation. The

Consumption charges and service charges. There is hereby established a water consumption charge and a water
service charge for the use of water and other services delivered and rendered by Consolidated Waterworks
District No. 1 of the Parish of Jefferson for all residences, apartment houses, multiple-family dwelling units,
mobile homes, public, parochial and private schools, academies and other such training institutions, all churches,
synagogues, temples and other places of worship, and all orphanages, and other not-for-profit, residential
institutions. Base charges for water consumption and water service are dependent on the quantity of water used
in gallons and the size of the water meter, respectively. Base charges will be adjusted annually beginning March
1, 2000 and thereafter every January 1st based on the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index. The
annual adjustment to these charges will equal a U.S. City Average 12 month percentage change in the All Urban
Consumers—All Items Index (CPI-U) as compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The actual rates for water
consumption and water service in effect for any given year will be published in the Official Journal of Jefferson
Parish and in the Progressive Jefferson, the publication ordinarily accompanying the water bills themselves.
(b)
Installation costs for water meters. Consolidated Waterworks District No. 1 of the Parish of Jefferson is hereby
authorized to charge actual installation costs incurred in the installation of all new and/or additional meters.
Costs of installation for various size meters will be posted in the water department annually and the meter
installation charge is due and payable in full at the time the application is made.
(c)
Deposit on newly established accounts. In order to ensure payment of the common utility bill, a cash deposit on
all newly established accounts is required. The cash deposit is to be held in surety of payment of all charges that
appear on the department of water common utility bill. The cash deposit is to be placed by the applicant at the
time application for service is made. The applicant must be eighteen (18) years or older to apply for water
service in his or her name. The account of cash deposit is related to the water meter size, number of units and
type of service (residence, business, etc.). The basic cash deposits required are:

<p>The above cash deposits are minimum amounts for the meter size indicated. Meters that exceed four (4) inches
will require the maximum deposit of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Multiple units that are being serviced by
an individual meter shall multiply the number of units times the charge for the above listed applicable meter
size. The maximum deposit required regardless of number of units is five hundred dollars ($500.00). Interest
earned on all deposits is factored into our public rates, helping to keep rates down, therefore, no interest is paid
to customers on deposits. Likewise, the Jefferson Parish Water Department has the right to increase a deposit in
order to protect itself against nonpayment.
(d)
Fire service, sprinkler system or internal fire protection system.
(1)
Cost of installation. All applicants for water service connections in Consolidated Waterworks District No. 1 of
the Parish of Jefferson for the purpose of a sprinkler system or internal fire protection system shall pay the cost
of all labor, equipment and material, plus ten (10) percent of each installation cost from the water mains to the
property line of applicant.
(2)
Meter requirement. Where fire service, sprinkler system or internal fire protection system is required by a
customer, no meter will be installed, but the customer shall be required to pay for the cost of fire service
installation as set forth above. No connections shall be made to the fire service lines other than the usual
sprinkler system and fire hose connections. All other use of water must be metered.

Fire service rates. The rate for fire services shall be a monthly or bi-monthly charge basis, payable in advance on
a monthly or bi-monthly basis. Fire service rates, private fire protection service shall be based on the size of
connection as follows:

Procedures. All procedures are fully outlined below and variations from these procedures will be allowed only
by supervisory approval from the department responsible for that phase of operation.
a.
Existing facilities:
1.
Selection of existing installations for investigations:
i.
Selection of existing installations for investigation shall be made solely on the basis of "suspected hazard."
These fields for investigation are taken from a list prepared by representatives from all concerned departments.
ii.
List of suspected high hazard installations: The following general fields of installations will be investigated in
the order of their listing:
Funeral homes;
Hospitals (clinics, etc.);
Plating and chemical companies;
Labs (industrial and medical);
Packing houses;
Manufacturing plants.
iii.
List of suspected low hazards:
Schools with lab;
Nursing and convalescent homes;
Hotels and motels;
Car washes and service stations;
Laundry and cleaners;
Restaurants and food handlers;
Major office buildings;
Apartment houses (high rise over thirty-six (36) feet high).
2.
Appointments. In most cases attempts will be made to secure an appointment with a representative of the
building owner. Appointments will be made or approved by the crossconnection control supervisor and will be
made by mutual agreement of consumer and parish.
3.
Survey. All surveys or investigations will be made in the following manner:
i.
The inspectors. An inspector from the cross-connection control group will contact the consumer in person at the
appointed time. He will briefly explain the objective of the survey and will ask the consumer or his appointed
agent to accompany him during his tour of the consumer's facilities.
ii.
Discussion with consumer. Any physical or seriously potential crossconnections that are discovered will be
pointed out to the consumer and explained. The inspector will also point out plumbing problems that might
result in poor pressure and/or wastage of water and will attempt to offer suggestions for improvement of these
problems.
iii.
Forms. When cross-connections are found to exist a written notice will be filled out in triplicate by the inspector.
He will make every effort to be sure that the information entered on the form is accurate and complete, and will
state on the notice how the hazards are to be corrected. Upon completion of the survey, the inspector will sign
the notice and will request the consumer's signature also.
iv.
Records. The top (original) copy of the notice will be given to the consumer upon completion of the survey. The
second copy is returned to the supervisor of crossconnection control. The third copy will be retained by the
inspector in the notice book. When the case is closed, the second copy with all appropriate notations will be
permanently filed and the third copy will be destroyed.
4.
Committee action. When unusual circumstances are encountered by the cross-connection section, that are not in
line with established policies, they shall be brought before the crossconnection liaison committee for a
discussion. The committee shall meet whenever necessary to review policies and to establish new policies to
guide the program.
5.
Notification and follow-up the department of inspection and code enforcement. A letter of notification to the
property owner, including references to related ordinances and information as to what corrective measures are
necessary, time limits, etc., shall be written and signed by the chief of the plumbing inspection division when
necessary for follow-up. Subsequent follow-up letters will also be written whenever necessary to secure
compliance. In case of noncompliance, when discontinuance of water service is necessary, a written request will
be made to the water department to the attention of the director, through the director of inspection and code
enforcement. The water department will then handle the actual discontinuance.
6.
Permits, installation and inspection. After the owner receives written notification, it becomes his responsibility
to correct the situation or install the appropriate device. A licensed plumber shall secure a permit from the
plumbing inspection division in accordance with the parish plumbing code. An inspector from the plumbing
inspection division will inspect and approve or disapprove the completed installation or testing procedure. The
cross-connection control supervisor shall at regular intervals send a report of the activities of the section to all
members of the cross-connection committee.
7.</p>
<p>Records and tests. Upon receipt of notice from the plumbing inspector, a permanent record file is set up in crossconnection control group. In order to ensure that backflow preventer devices continue to operate satisfactorily, it
will be necessary that they be periodically tested. Such tests will be conducted in accordance with manufacturer's
performance standards and test procedures.
8.
Emergency procedures. If any employee of the parish should discover a hazardous situation where contaminants
are actually in the process or suspected of entering the distribution system of the department of water, he is
authorized to take such immediate steps as necessary to stop backflow. He is further responsible for contacting
the water department without delay and notifying the supervisor of distribution of the need for flushing the
contaminants out of the system. If discontinuance of service is required, the matter shall be brought to the
attention of the director of inspection and code enforcement and the office of the director of water.
