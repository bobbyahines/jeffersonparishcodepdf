Sec. 12.6-9. - Administration.
(a)
The authority and responsibility for administering this chapter are with the Louisiana Department of Justice,

employees of the office of the governor or to boards or agencies under the authority of the governor, the
functions, duties, and powers with respect to mediating, investigating, conciliating, hearing, determining,

(2)
For purposes of mediation, under this chapter, the attorney general shall appoint a panel, consisting of three (3)

employees of the attorney general's office.
(c)
All state, parish, and local departments and agencies shall administer their programs and activities relating to

(2)
Publish and disseminate reports, recommendations, and information derived from such studies.

this chapter.
(Ord. No. 25063 , § 10, 12-9-15)
Sec. 12.6-10. - Enforcement.
(a)
An aggrieved person claiming to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice, or who believes that he
will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur, may file a complaint with the attorney
general. The civil rights section may also file a complaint on behalf of any person. On receipt of the complaint,
the attorney general shall:
(1)
Give the aggrieved person notice that the complaint has been filed and advise the aggrieved person of the time
limits and choice of forums under this chapter.
(2)
Not later than ten (10) days after the filing of the complaint, serve the respondent a notice identifying the alleged
discriminatory housing practice and advising the respondent of the procedural rights and obligations of a
respondent under this chapter, together with a copy of the original complaint.
(b)
A complaint pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be filed not later than one (1) year after the alleged
discriminatory housing practice occurs. A complaint shall be in writing and shall state the facts on which the
allegations of a discriminatory housing practice are based. The complaint shall contain any other information
and be in the form that the attorney general requires. The complaint may be reasonably and fairly amended at
any time. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint against him not later than the tenth day after receipt
of the notice and copy pursuant to subsection (a)(2) and, with the consent of the attorney general, which shall be
granted if it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend his answer at any time. The attorney general may
require both complaints and answers to be verified.
(c)
(1)
Within ten (10) days after the receipt of the respondent's answer or, if no answer is filed within the time
prescribed in subsection (b), within five (5) days after the expiration of such time, the attorney general, or a
certified agency, if the complaint has been referred pursuant to this subsection, must refer the complaint to a
mediation panel under this subsection. If the parties agree to a settlement through mediation, and the mediated
settlement is in writing and signed by both parties, the attorney general shall dismiss the complaint, if the
attorney general approves the agreement and finds it to be in the public interest.
(2)
If the complaint has not been resolved through mediation within thirty (30) days after referral to the mediation
panel, it must be returned to the attorney general or certified agency for investigation, which shall commence
immediately. If the complaint is returned to the attorney general, he shall investigate the complaint and may
proceed to try to eliminate or correct the alleged discriminatory housing practice by informal methods of
conference, conciliation, and mediation. If the attorney general determines after investigation that there is not
reasonable cause to believe that the complaint is true, he shall enter an order dismissing the complaint and shall
notify the complainant and the respondent of his action. If the attorney general determines after investigation
that there is reasonable cause to believe that the complaint is true, he shall enter an order containing his findings
of fact and shall endeavor to eliminate the alleged unlawful housing practice by informal methods of conference,
conciliation, and persuasion.
(3)
Nothing said or done in the course of these informal endeavors may be made public, provided that if a civil
action resulting from a complaint is commenced in any federal or state court, evidence collected by or submitted
to the attorney general during investigation of the complaint and the source of the evidence are discoverable by
the parties to the civil action in accordance with applicable rules of evidence, procedure, and discovery.
(d)
(1)
If a complaint alleges a discriminatory housing practice within the jurisdiction of a local public agency which
has been certified by the attorney general under this subsection, and the local public agency has entered into an
intergovernmental agreement pursuant to section 12.6-9, the attorney general may refer the complaint to that
certified agency before taking any action with respect to the complaint. The attorney general shall take no
further action with respect to the complaint unless the certified agency has not acted in a timely fashion after the
date the complaint was received or unless the attorney general determines that the certified agency no longer
qualifies for certification under this subsection under the circumstance of a particular case, or the rights of the
parties or interest of justice requires this action.
(2)
In order to determine that the substantive rights protected by the agency, the procedures followed by the agency,
the remedies available to the agency, and the availability of judicial review of the agency's action are
substantially equivalent to those established by this chapter and qualify the agency for this certification, the
attorney general shall take into account the current practices and past performance, if any, of the agency.
(e)
All conciliation agreements shall provide that the complainant waives, releases, and covenants not to sue the
respondent or claim against the respondent in any forum with respect to the matters which were alleged as
complaints filed with the attorney general, subject to the performance by the respondent of the promises and
representations contained in the conciliation agreement. All conciliation agreements shall be in writing and
agreed to by the complainant, the respondent, and the attorney general or his designee.
(f)
The attorney general shall complete the investigation of an alleged discriminatory housing practice within one
hundred (100) days after the filing of the complaint, or when the attorney general takes further action pursuant to
subsection (d), within one hundred (100) days after the commencement of such further action, unless it is
impracticable to do so.
(g)
If the attorney general is unable to complete the investigation within the time period set forth in subsection (f),
the attorney general shall notify the parties in writing of the reasons for not doing so.
(Ord. No. 25063 , § 11, 12-9-15)
Sec. 12.6-11. - Right to examine and copy evidence; summoning witnesses and documents and taking testimony;
right to counsel; court aid; service and return; fees of witnesses.
(a)
In conducting an investigation, the section or its duly authorized employees shall have access at all reasonable
times to premises, records, documents, individuals, and other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may
examine, record, and copy such materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons as are
reasonably necessary for the furtherance of the investigation. The section may issue interrogatories to a
respondent to the same extent and subject to the same limitations as would apply if the interrogatories were
issued or served in aid of a civil action in the state district courts for the district in which the investigation is
taking place.
(b)
The section, on its own initiative, or on application of any party to the proceeding, may issue subpoenas
compelling the attendance and testimony of witnesses or requiring the production of documents for examination
or copying. Within five (5) days after the service of a subpoena on any person, the person may petition the
section to revoke, limit, or modify the subpoena. The section shall revoke, limit, or modify the subpoena if in its
opinion the evidence required does not relate to unlawful practices covered by this chapter, is not relevant to the
complaint which is the subject matter of the investigation, does not describe with sufficient particularity the
evidence that is subpoenaed, is unduly burdensome or oppressive, or for other good reason. Any member of the
section or any agent designated by the section may administer oaths or affirmations, examine witnesses, and
receive the witness.
(c)
Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the section shall be entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are
witnesses in proceedings in state district courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a subpoena issued at the
request of a party shall be paid by that party.
(d)
In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena, the section or other person at whose request it was issued
may petition for its enforcement in the state district court for the district in which the person to whom the
subpoena was addressed resides, was served, or transacts business.
(e)
Any person appearing before the section may be represented by counsel.
(f)
The district court, on application by the section or by the person subpoenaed, has jurisdiction to issue an order
revoking, limiting, or modifying the subpoena or conditioning issuance of the subpoena on payment of costs or
expenses incurred to comply with the subpoena, if in the court's opinion the evidence required does not relate to
unlawful practices covered by this chapter, is not relevant to the complaint which is the subject matter of the
investigation, does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence that is subpoenaed, is unduly
burdensome or oppressive, or for other good reason.
(g)
Complaints, orders, and other process and papers of the section or the agent of the section may be served either
personally or by certified mail by commercial courier as defined in R.S. 13:3204(D), when the person to be
served is located outside of this state. The verified return by the individual serving the complaints, orders,
process, or papers, setting forth the manner of service, is proof of service. The return post office receipt, if
certified and mailed as provided in this subsection, is proof of service.
(Ord. No. 25063 , § 12, 12-9-15)
Sec. 12.6-12. - Enforcement by private persons.
(a)
If no complaint has been filed with the attorney general pursuant to section 12.6-10, an aggrieved person may
commence a civil action for enforcement of the rights granted pursuant to this chapter in an appropriate state
court of general jurisdiction within two (2) years after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred.
(b)</p>
<p>An action to obtain relief arising from a breach of conciliation agreement entered into pursuant to this chapter
may be commenced in an appropriate state court of general jurisdiction within one (1) year after the alleged
breach.
(c)
If a complaint filed with the attorney general pursuant to section 12.6-10 is dismissed by the attorney general, or
if within the time period set forth in section 12.6-10 the attorney general has not:
(1)
Filed a civil action under section 12.6-13,
(2)
Entered into a conciliation agreement with the complainant and respondent, the attorney general shall notify the
complainant or the party on whose behalf the complaint was filed. In no event, including the failure of the
attorney general to issue the notification required herein, shall any action be brought pursuant to this chapter
more than two (2) years after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred. On timely application, the
court, in its discretion, may permit the attorney general to intervene in civil actions in which this state is not a
defendant on certification that the case is of general public importance. On request, the court, in its discretion,
may stay further proceedings for not more than sixty (60) days pending the further efforts of the parties or the
attorney general to obtain voluntary compliance.
(d)
Upon application by the plaintiff and in such circumstances as the court may deem just, a district court in which
a civil action under this section has been brought may appoint an attorney for the plaintiff and may authorize the
commencement of a civil action upon proper showing without the payment of fees, costs, or security, to the
extent not inconsistent with the law or procedures of this state.
(e)
The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary
restraining order, or other order and may award to a prevailing plaintiff actual damages and punitive damages,
together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees.

Any sale, encumbrance, or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any court order issued pursuant to the
authority provided in this chapter and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual
notice of the existence of the filing of a complaint or civil action under the provisions of this chapter shall not be
affected.
(g)
Nothing in this chapter shall impair any right to sue or cause of action arising under 42 United States Code,
Sections 3610, 3612, and 3613, except, if applicable, on agreement between the parties.
(h)
If a party elects to proceed on a claim in a federal court, he shall be precluded from filing the same claim in an
appropriate court of this state.
(i)
The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, court costs and reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing
defendant, consistent with federal civil rights statutes.
(Ord. No. 25063 , § 13, 12-9-15)
Sec. 12.6-13. - Enforcement by attorney general.
(a)
If, after investigation of a complaint filed pursuant to section 12.6-10, the attorney general finds reasonable
cause to believe that any person or group of persons is engaged in resistance to the full enjoyment of any of the
rights granted pursuant to this chapter or that any person or group of persons has been denied any of the rights
granted pursuant to this chapter, and the complainant, the respondent, and the attorney general have not entered
into a conciliation agreement, he shall bring a civil action in any appropriate state district court requesting relief,
including an application for a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or other order against the
person or persons responsible for the resistance or denial of rights.
(b)
In any civil action pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the court may grant as relief, as it deems
appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order and may award
actual damages and punitive damages to any person found to have been denied any of the rights granted
pursuant to this chapter.
(c)
If the attorney general concludes at any time following the filing of a complaint that a discriminatory housing
practice has occurred or is about to occur, he shall promptly commence and maintain a civil action for
appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of the complaint.
