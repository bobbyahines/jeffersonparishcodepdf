<p>(a)
Whenever animals are kept within any building or on any premises without food, water or proper care and
attention, or are kept in violation of the provisions of this article, or are infected with disease, or kept under
conditions which could endanger public health or create a nuisance, it shall be the duty of any authorized
employee of the animal shelter department, or any person issued and authorized to wear the animal shelter
badge, to enter the building or premises to take possession of and remove the animals so abandoned or
neglected. Animals and birds so impounded shall not be released before the reason for causing the impoundment
has been corrected.
(b)
If any impounded animal, other than a dog or cat impounded for being at large, is not reclaimed by the owner
upon payment of impoundment and daily board fees and compliance with other legal requirements for keeping
an animal, or if the reason for causing the impoundment is not corrected within a reasonable time, the animal
shall be held for such time as the director deems reasonable, considering the animal's probable value, condition
of health and suitability for use. Upon expiration of such reasonable time, the director of the animal shelter may
offer the animal for adoption, or it may be humanely destroyed.

impounded, or as an alternative, the humane officer finding the dog at large may issue a notice to the owner that
his dog is in violation of this section. Such notice will impose upon the dog owner a fine of ten dollars ($10.00)
and shall be paid to the parish in person or by mail within five (5) days of the time the notice was served. Failure
to make such payment shall render such owner subject to the penalties provided for in section 7-33.
(b)
Redemption. The owner shall be entitled to resume possession of any impounded dog upon payment of the
impoundment and daily board fees and compliance with vaccination/registration requirements; provided
application for such possession, with payment of all required fees, is made within four (4) days, exclusive of
Sundays and all legal holidays, after impoundment.

Should an animal bite a person, or be reported to have bitten a person within the limits of the parish, it shall be
the duty of the owner, alleged victim or the person having the alleged animal in his possession or under his
control to: (1) immediately notify the animal shelter department, and surrender the animal to any animal control
officer, animal shelter director or designee of the parish animal shelter department, who is herewith authorized
and empowered to enter the premises in order to make any inspection or examination of the animal as may be
deemed necessary by the animal shelter department and (2) provide evidence of the bite including but not
limited to a written statement of the incident, photographs, and/or a doctor's report. It shall be the duty of the
parish animal shelter department to impound or cause to be impounded any such animal that has bitten a human
for a period of ten (10) days for observation either in the hospital facilities of a licensed veterinarian in Jefferson
Parish or at the parish animal shelter and in rare cases, quarantined at the owner's home pursuant to subsection
(b). The animal shelter veterinarian, parish health unit, or other designated and qualified person may order the
destruction of such animal upon displaying symptoms of illness and send the specimen to the bureau of
laboratories of the state department of health for a rabies laboratory test. Destruction of such animal is
considered an emergency and such destruction shall be done without notice to the owner, keeper and/or harborer
or a hearing. Such destruction without a right to notice or a hearing is due to the imminent nature of the disease
as such presents an imminent danger to the life, safety and welfare of the victim(s) and others exposed to the
animal.
(b)
A home quarantine of the dog or cat, with the approval of the animal shelter director or designee may be allowed
if the following conditions are met:
(1)
The animal must be current on its rabies vaccination;
(2)
The bite does not result in severe injury;
(3)
There was only one (1) victim;
(4)
There is no previous bite, attack or running at large history for the animal;
(5)
The owner, caregiver, or person that has custody or possession of said animal is willing to sign the appropriate
home quarantine agreement understanding that any violation of the agreement will result in impoundment of the
animal at the animal shelter or a veterinary clinic in Jefferson Parish;
(6)
The owner, caregiver, or person having custody or possession of the animal must agree to not have said animal
vaccinated for rabies until completion of the ten-day quarantine, and release by the parish animal shelter;
(7)
An animal control officer must verify that the owner, caretaker, or person having custody or possession of the
animal has the ability to securely, safely, and humanely confine such animal for the ten-day quarantine period;
(8)
The animal must appear to be healthy at the time the home quarantine begins.
(c)
If the director of the animal shelter or designee determines that such animal may be confined under the control
or custody of the owner or person having control over it, the owner or person shall notify the animal shelter
department immediately if the animal shows any symptoms of sickness or abnormal behavior, or escapes, and if
such animal dies during confinement, such person having custody thereof shall notify the animal shelter and
surrender the body to the animal shelter department for rabies testing for preparation and submission to the
parish health department. Failure to notify as provided herein shall result in penalties in section 7-84 and/or
other provisions of this Code.
(d)
If a home quarantine is allowed, an animal control officer shall conduct a visual examination of the animal and
photograph it at the outset of and upon conclusion of the ten-day period take additional photographs of the
animal prior to releasing it from such home quarantine if the animal appears to be healthy.
(e)
If the animal control officer finds any signs of illness or change in behavior of the home quarantined animal, the
officer must immediately notify the shelter veterinarian or director or other designee, to determine a proper
course of action.

rats, gerbils, hamsters or guinea pigs and any other animal that may be specifically excluded by the animal
shelter veterinarian or parish health unit.
(b)
Non-mammalian animals are not capable of contracting rabies or infecting other animals with the rabies virus.
Therefore animals that are avian, reptilian, or amphibian will not require ten-day rabies quarantine or testing.
(c)
Certain mammals, particularly "wild" animals, including but not limited to raccoons, skunks, and bats that bite a
human will require immediate euthanasia and rabies testing. These animals are considered to be more likely to
carry and transmit the rabies virus than other mammals. Ferrets can be quarantined and observed for ten-day
observation only with the approval of the state public health veterinarian and only if current rabies vaccination
can be verified for the biting animal. Exceptions to required testing of wildlife may be made only by the state
public health veterinarian for properly licensed wildlife rehabilitators and only at the specific, written request of
the victim.
(d)
Livestock animals that bite a human are handled at the discretion of the animal shelter veterinarian. Such
handling may include testing which results in euthanasia.

<p>All stables shall, in addition to all other requirements of this article, comply with the requirements set forth
below. Failure to meet these requirements shall be grounds for denial for a permit to operate, or revocation for
any previously issued permit.
(1)
Application for permit. Permit application forms may be obtained from the animal shelter department at #1
Humane Way, P.O. Box 10640, Jefferson LA 70181-0640, or may be requested in writing or by telephone.
Completed, notarized forms accompanied by the appropriate fee may be mailed to the above address. If an
applicant certifies that all of the requirements of these rules and regulations are being met in his establishment,
the animal shelter department may issue a temporary permit until such time as it may make a physical inspection
of the establishment. Such temporary permit, however, shall not be valid for more than three (3) months from
date of issue, and shall be revoked at the time of inspection if all permit requirements are not being met. Upon
certification by an authorized representative of the animal shelter department that all pertinent requirements are
being met, the director shall forthwith issue a regular permit which shall be valid until December thirty-first of
the year issued.
(2)
Renewal of permit. Prior to December thirty-first of each year all holders of animal handling permits must renew
same by applying to the animal shelter department for the appropriate form, executing such form and remitting
the current annual permit fee.
(3)
Inspection. All stables shall be subject to inspection at any time by the animal shelter department.
(4)
Minimum standards for care of animals:
a.
Feeding. All animals shall be provided twice daily with food and continuously with water, free from
contamination. Feed shall be wholesome, palatable, and of sufficient quantity and nutritive value to meet the
normal daily requirements of the animal.
b.
Riding equipment. All equipment used for riding must be properly fitted for each animal and be suited to the use
of the animal.
c.
Sanitation. All structures used for the stabling of animals shall be kept clean and in good repair and shall be kept
adequately lighted and ventilated and provide protection from the weather.
Manure shall be removed from all structures used for stabling of animals at intervals sufficient to assure dry,
sanitary, odor free conditions inside the structure. Manure removed from the area must be disposed of or treated
in a manner which assures prevention of insect growth, deterrence of disease, and odor control. Manure disposal
shall be suited to the size and location of the stable area.
Any enclosure where animals are kept, other than an enclosed structure, shall be kept graded and drained so as to
keep the area reasonably dry. Removal of treatment of fecal matter must provide prevention of insect growth,
disease deterrence, and odor control.
d.
Fly control. Flies must be controlled through general sanitation practices. The type of product used for fly and
insect control should be suited to the size and location of the stable or enclosure.
e.
Health of the animals. Animals should show signs of regular attention and care. The name of the attendant
veterinarian for each animal should be available to the animal shelter inspector upon request.
f.
Disputed findings. If the owner/operator of the stable should be unable to come to an agreement with the animal
shelter inspectors as to the sanitation of the premises, the health department shall be asked to issue an opinion as
to the general conditions of sanitation. In a dispute over the health or condition of the animal, the owner/operator
shall have the right to present the opinion of his own veterinarian to the inspector before a decision is reached. If
further veterinary advice is warranted, the shelter veterinarian may be consulted after the attending veterinarian
has been notified. In all cases, the owner/operator has the right to petition the board for a hearing before his
permit is refused or revoked.

<p>(a)
When a person is charged with cruelty to animal(s), said person's animal or animals may be seized by the
arresting officer, animal control officer or official issuing the citation or summons and held pursuant to this
section.
(b)
Disposition of such animals:
(1)
Prior to seizing the animal(s), a search and/or seizure warrant must be obtained unless exigent circumstances
exist which is defined in JPCO Section 7-16. The seizing officer shall notify the owner(s) of the seized animal of
the provisions of this section by posting an original or a copy of the search warrant at the location or other
documentation of seizure where the animal was seized if under exigent circumstances or by leaving it with a
person of suitable age and discretion residing at that location at the time of the seizure. The search warrant or
other documentation will serve as the notice of violation. The bond notice shall be posted within twenty-four
(24) hours of the seizure.
a.
The bond notice shall contain the case number, the parties name(s) and mailing address(es), and estimated
housing costs pending the hearing date for either civil or criminal prosecution at ten dollars ($10.00) per day not
including medical expenses. An expedited hearing before the bureau of administrative adjudication can be had
upon the defendant(s) and victim(s) waiving the hearing notice requirement found in JPCO Section 2.5.
b.
The named party has fifteen (15) days from the date the bond notice is posted to pay the estimated housing costs
for thirty (30) days of housing the animal(s). Failure to pay the estimated housing costs in full within fifteen (15)
days, including weekends and holidays, will result in the Jefferson Parish Animal Shelter, in its discretion,
holding the seized animal out for adoption, fostering, euthanization etc. as it deems reasonable. If the initial bond
amount is paid within the fifteen (15) day period, the animal(s) will be held in custody in the shelter or other
approved location.
c.
Each additional bond period shall be for thirty (30) days until a final disposition has been rendered by the bureau
of administrative adjudication or a court of competent jurisdiction.
d.</p>
<p>All bonds must be posted at the animal shelter, by a person claiming an interest in the seized animal, within
fifteen (15) days, including weekends and holidays, upon posting to prevent the animal shelter director or
designee in placing the seized animal as it deems reasonable.
e.
The bureau of administrative adjudication or a court of competent jurisdiction shall order that the bond be given
to the animal shelter department to be used to cover the cost of housing the seized animal(s).
f.
Posting of a bond shall not prevent the Jefferson Parish Animal Shelter from placing the seized animal (holding
it out for foster or euthanization) for humane purposes in accordance with this chapter or exigent circumstances.
(2)
The seizing officer shall photograph the animal within twenty-four (24) hours of issuing the search warrant and
shall cause an affidavit to be prepared in order to document its condition in accordance with R.S. 15:436.2.
(3)
The seizing officer shall secure a licensed veterinarian or other suitable custodian to care for any such animal.
The custodian shall retain custody of the animal in accordance with this section.
(4)
The seized animal shall be held by the animal shelter or the place of transfer for a minimum period of fifteen
(15) consecutive days, including weekends and holidays, after such bond notice is given. Thereafter, if a person
who claims an interest in such animal has not posted bond in accordance with this section, the Jefferson Parish
Animal Shelter may, in its discretion, hold the seized animal out for adoption, fostering, euthanization etc.
(c)
Upon a person's adjudication or conviction of cruelty to animals, in addition to all fines, costs and punishment
authorized by law:
(1)
It shall be proper for the bureau of administrative adjudication or a court of competent jurisdiction, in its
discretion, to order the forfeiture and final disposition of the custody of any animal found to be cruelly treated in
accordance with this section and the forfeiture of the bond posted pursuant to subsection (b) as part of the
sentence. The bureau of administrative adjudication or a court of competent jurisdiction may, in its discretion,
order the payment of any reasonable costs, including but not limited to housing costs, incurred in the boarding or
veterinary treatment of any seized animal prior to its disposition of the animal, whether or not a bond was posted
by the defendant. In the event of the acquittal or final discharge without conviction of the accused, the bureau of
administrative adjudication or a court of competent jurisdiction shall, on demand, direct the delivery of any
animal held in custody to the owner thereof and order the return of any bond posted pursuant to subsection (b),
less reasonable administrative costs.
(2)
Nothing in this section shall prevent the euthanasia of any seized animal, at any time, whether or not any bond
was posted, if a licensed veterinarian determines that the animal is not likely to survive and is suffering, as a
result of any physical condition. In such instances, the bureau of administrative adjudication or a court of
competent jurisdiction, in its discretion, may order the return of any bond posted, less reasonable costs, at the
time of trial.
(3)
The animal shelter director may impose a fee for cruelty investigation that results in conviction as a result of
violations related to such investigation and the cost of investigation. The fee shall be a maximum of three
hundred dollars ($300.00) per investigation. The investigation fee is in addition to any other fees or penalties
associated with the provisions of this chapter or imposed by this chapter payable directly to the animal shelter
department.
(d)
The animal shelter may, in its discretion, hold the seized animal out for adoption, fostering, euthanization etc.
due to the failure of the owner or interested parties to act including but not limited to posting of bond(s) or
redemption of a seized animal within seventy-two (72) hours of a final disposition of the bureau of
administrative adjudication or if a court of competent jurisdiction releases the animal to the custody of the owner
or keeper, the person charged to be in violation under Division 6 of Chapter 7 shall have no legal right or
recourse against the animal shelter or adoptive person and shall hold harmless all persons and entities associated
with said adoption or other disposition.

order for the animal to be spayed or neutered, micro-chipped and have updated vaccinations at the cost to the
defendant and any other reasonable provision(s) that the hearing officer deems warranted in his discretion.
(b)

committed the crime of simple and/or aggravated cruelty to animals then said defendant(s) shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.
