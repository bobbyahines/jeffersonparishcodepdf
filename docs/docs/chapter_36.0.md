When the violation is issued pursuant to the ordinance for an alleged violation the vehicle owner is the person
responsible for the payment of the fine. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the person whose name the
vehicle is registered was the operator of the vehicle at the time the alleged violation was committed.
Additionally, any operator of a vehicle who is not the vehicle owner, but who uses or operates the vehicle with
the permission of the owner, express or implied, shall be considered the agent of the owner to receive the
violation required to be sent to the vehicle owner. When the vehicle owner appears to have violated this article,
he/she will be issued a notice of violation that will include both the recorded image and sub image. Before the
notice is sent to the vehicle owner, the violation will be reviewed by both the company that owns the
enforcement equipment and the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office to ensure that the violation is accurately
recorded.
(b)
The vehicle owner will have thirty (30) days to respond to the violation notice by either paying the fine or

(d)
If after the second notification the vehicle owner fails to pay the fine or contest the fine, then the violation will
be sent to the Jefferson Parish First and Second Parish Courts, and processed for review by the Jefferson Parish
District Attorney's Office to be handled in a manner consistent with that of a parking violation.

The parish council finds and determines that a vehicle that proceeds into an intersection when the traffic signal
for that vehicle's direction of travel is emitting a steady red signal damages the public by endangering motor
vehicle operators and pedestrians alike, by decreasing the efficiency of traffic control and traffic flow efforts,
and by increasing the number of serious accidents to which public safety agencies must respond at the expense
of the taxpayers.
The registered owner of a motor vehicle which proceeds into an intersection at a system location when the traffic
control signal for the motor vehicle's direction of travel is emitting a steady red signal shall be liable for a
minimum penalty of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) plus any additional costs assessed for the enforcement of this
article, but in no event shall the total fine plus enforcement costs exceed one hundred seventy-five dollars
($175.00) per violation. Notwithstanding the limitations on the amount of the fine imposed under this article,
however, any court which handles any part of the prosecution for a violation under this article may impose costs
upon the person responsible for the fine in addition to the fine and enforcement costs imposed under this article.
(Ord. No. 23083, § 1, 6-20-07)

owner was driving the vehicle at the time the violation occurred. The vehicle owner's sworn statement must
provide the name, address, and contact phone number for the person whom the vehicle owner alleges was

liability for any fines and costs assessed for the violation. In addition, failure of the person alleged by the vehicle
owner to have been driving the vehicle at the time of the violation to pay any and all fines or costs assessed for
said violation shall result in the continued liability of the vehicle owner for said fines and costs.

then the violation will be sent to the Jefferson Parish First and Second Parish Courts to be processed for review
and handling by the Jefferson Parish District Attorney's Office in a manner consistent with the review and
handling of a parking violation.
(b)

liable for the penalty no later than the thirtieth day after the date the violation is alleged to have occurred or no

the notice of violation is mailed.

The enforcement of the provisions of this article is hereby suspended during any period of voluntary or
mandatory evacuation called by the parish president in accordance with the provisions of section 9-9 of the
