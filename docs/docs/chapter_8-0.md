set forth in Chapter 8 of the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances, entitled "Buildings and Building Regulations,"
within eighteen (18) months of the date of issuance of the building permit, except as provided below.
For any single-family residential dwelling permit issued prior to June 30, 2003, the exterior of the dwelling and
accessory structure(s) must be completed within six (6) months of the effective date of this ordinance in
accordance with this ordinance;
For any single-family residential dwelling permit issued on or after June 30, 2003, but prior to September 1,
2005, the exterior of the dwelling and accessory structure(s) must be completed within twelve (12) months of the
effective date of this ordinance in accordance with this ordinance;
For any single-family residential dwelling permit issued on or after September 1, 2005, but prior to the effective
date of this ordinance, the exterior of the dwelling and accessory structure(s) must be completed within eighteen
(18) months of the effective date of this ordinance in accordance with this ordinance;
For any single-family residential dwelling permit issued on or after the effective date of this ordinance, the
exterior of the dwelling and accessory structure(s) must be completed within eighteen (18) months of the
issuance of the permit in accordance with this ordinance.
ii.
After the above-stated applicable exterior completion period, the construction or renovation site must be clear of
all trash, debris, and construction materials with final grade established and being maintained in a neat and
orderly manner in accordance with the requirements of this code.
b.
The department of inspection and code enforcement ("the code official") may grant one (1) extension of a period
of not more than ninety (90) days for the completion of the exterior of the single-family residential dwelling and
accessory structure(s) with justifiable cause shown and provided a written certification is made by the code
official that the site is free and clear of all debris, trash, or building materials with final grade established and the
site is being maintained in a neat and orderly manner in accordance with the standards set forth in Chapter 8 of
the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances. Any extension granted by the code official shall be in writing.
Justifiable cause for an extension includes, but is not limited to, size and scope of construction prevented
completion within the applicable exterior completion periods and documented delays in the acquisition of
necessary labor or building materials.
c.
The holder of the permit for a single-family residential dwelling for which the exterior of the dwelling and
related accessory structure(s) are not completed within the applicable exterior completion periods outline above,
i.e., six (6), twelve (12) or eighteen (18) months plus an extension if granted, shall be in violation of this section
from the expiration of the applicable exterior completion period until a written certification, following an
investigation, is issued by the code official that the exterior of the structure of the dwelling and accessory
structure(s) are completed and the site is free and clear of all debris, trash and building materials with the final
grade established and that the site is being maintained in a neat and orderly manner in accordance with the
standards set forth in Chapter 8 of the Jefferson Parish Code of Ordinances, and shall be subject to the fines and
penalties below. A fee of three hundred dollars ($300.00) shall be required for each such inspection and each reinspection.
d.
Failure to comply with the applicable exterior completion period for a single-family residence shall invalidate
the issued permit and a new permit shall be required for that project. A new permit shall not be issued unless and
until the written certification is issued by the code official that the exterior of the dwelling and related accessory
structure(s) are completed and the site is free and clear of all debris, trash and building materials with the final
grade established and that the site is being maintained in a neat and orderly manner. Only work that is directly
related to the completion of the exterior of the dwelling and related structure(s), the clearance of all debris, trash
and building materials, the establishment of the final grade or the maintenance of the site in a neat and orderly
manner shall be allowed on the project during the period after the initial permit has become invalid and prior to
the issuance of a new permit.

The violation of any provision of this section shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars
($500.00) or imprisonment for a term not exceeding six (6) months or by both such fine and imprisonment,
within the discretion of the court. Each day any violation of any provision of this section shall continue
constitutes a separate offense.

#### DIVISION 3. - OTHER RESTRICTIONS
Subdivision A. - Minimum Housing Standards
Sec. 8-3-110.1. - Administration.
Sec. 8-3-110.1.1. - Title and policy.
The provisions embraced within this subdivision shall constitute and shall be known as and may be cited as the
"Minimum Housing Standards."
It is found and declared that there exist in the unincorporated areas of the Parish of Jefferson certain substandard
and unsanitary residential building and dwelling units characterized by physical conditions which render them
unfit and unsafe for human habitation. These conditions are of such nature as to be detrimental to the health,
safety, and welfare of the occupants thereof as well as the public at large.
It is further found and declared that there exist in the unincorporated areas of the Parish of Jefferson residential
buildings and dwelling units which were originally constructed according to standards now recognized to be
obsolete and deficient in terms of current modern housing standards governing construction, use, occupancy,
light, ventilation, safety and sanitary facilities. The continued existence of these obsolete and deficient
residential building and dwelling units is detrimental to the health, safety, and welfare of the occupants thereof
and the public at large.
It is further found that the existence of such substandard, unsanitary, obsolete, and deficient buildings used for
dwelling purposes threatens the physical and economic stability of the surrounding residential buildings and
neighborhood facilities, occasions disproportionate expenditure of public funds for remedial action, and
jeopardizes the well-being of the entire community.
Therefore, it is in the public interest of the citizens of the unincorporated areas of Jefferson Parish to protect and
promote decent, safe, and sanitary residential building and dwelling units by the adoption and enforcement of
the minimum housing standards of this subdivision.
The adoption and enforcement of this Minimum Housing Standards is hereby declared to be a necessary

of this subdivision by virtue of being unsafe, unsanitary, unfit for human habitation, or not provided with
adequate egress; or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life; or which in relation
to existing use constitute a hazard to safety or health by reasons of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation,
obsolescence, or abandonment; are hereby declared to be public nuisances and shall be abated by repair,
rehabilitation, demolition and/or removal.

One which lacks illumination, ventilation, or sanitation facilities adequate to protect the health or safety of the
occupants or of the public.
(B)
Whenever the director has declared a dwelling or multi-family dwelling as unfit for human habitation and
constituting a nuisance, he shall give notice to the owner of such declaration and placarding of the dwelling or
multi-family dwelling as unfit for human habitation. Such notice shall:
(a)
Be in writing;
(b)
Include a legal description of the real estate sufficient for identification;

residence or building already exists, and which lot drains to the rear and the required elevation on the lot where
the new construction is proposed is higher than the existing elevation of the lot on which the residence or
building exists, then:
1.
A drainage servitude on the lot containing the new construction is dedicated and properly recorded to drain the
lot on which the residence or building already exists; and
2.
Drainage facilities are properly installed on the lot containing the new construction.
No newly constructed residence or building shall be released for occupancy and no notification of release shall
be sent to the utility companies until the above described drainage servitude and drainage facility requirements
have been accomplished.
This section applies only in those cases where the rear lot on which a building already exists cannot raise its
grade because it would cause run-off damage to the building thereon.
The above servitude requirements shall not apply to isolated singularly-developed properties.
Certificate of use and occupancy and compliance shall not be issued until a final elevation certificate has been
secured.
(Ord. No. 22756, § 4, 5-17-06)

residential use, the top of slab (floor) shall not be less than eighteen (18) inches above the crown of the street.
For non-residential use, the top of slab shall be at or above the base flood elevation established by FEMA on its
FIRM or the structure, together with all attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall be designed so below the
base flood level, the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All
structural components must have the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects
of buoyancy.
Where flood proofing is utilized to obtain compliance, a state registered civil engineer or state registered
architect shall certify that the flood-proofing methods are adequate to withstand the flood depths, pressures,
velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors associated with the base flood. For non-residential uses, the
top of slab (floor) shall not be less than six (6) inches above the crown of the street.
All construction in V zones shall also conform to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)

Sec. 8-5-119.30.4.1. - Pile load capacity for a single pile.
The allowable load capacity for a single pile shall be determined by a load test made under the direction of an
accredited independent testing laboratory or a Louisiana Registered Civil Engineer. The load capacity for a
single pile shall be established by any of the following methods:
Method 1—When the total test load applied equals twice the proposed load capacity for a single pile; it shall be
left in place at least forty-eight (48) hours, the last twenty-four (24) hours of which shall be free from settlement.
If, after deducting rebound following the total release of this load, the net settlement at the top of the pile does
not exceed 0.01 inch per ton of total test load, the pile shall be considered adequate to support the proposed load
capacity for a single pile.
Method 2—Where the pile is loaded to failure, the loading value where the load settlement curve begins to show
an accelerated deviation from its previous trend may be considered the "yield point" for the given soil and pile,
one-half (½) this value or one-half (½) the value at which the net settlement is estimated as one-half (½) inch,
whichever is smaller, shall be considered as the load capacity for a single pile.
Method 3—The failure load of a pile, half of which shall be used as the load capacity for a single pile, shall be
defined as that load which produces a settlement or movement of the tip equal to one-quarter (¼) inch. The
movement of the tip can be determined by actual measurement or by either of the following two (2) load
distribution cases, both involving the measurement of the butt movement. In each case, the failure load shall be
defined as that load producing a movement of the butt equal to the elastic deflection of the pile under the failure
load plus one-quarter (¼) inch.
Sec. 8-5-119.30.4.2. - Arbitrary load distribution case.
In determining the elastic deflection of the pile, the assumption may be made that the soil-pile friction value is
constant from tip to butt and that tip bearing is ignored. For a prismatic pile of one (1) material, the butt
movement shall be calculated by the expression shown on the next following page.
Df = (PfL/2AE) + 0.25 in, in which
Df = Butt movement, in
Pf = Failure load, kips
L = Pile length, in
A = Pile cross-sectional area, sq in
E = Modulus of elasticity, kips psi

(Ord. No. 22756, § 4, 5-17-06)
Sec. 8-5-119.30.4.3. - Actual load distribution case.
In determining the elastic deflection of the pile, the actual distribution of stress into the soil may be used

(Ord. No. 22756, § 4, 5-17-06)
Sec. 8-5-119.30.4.4. - Variations.
A variation of the load capacity of a load-tested pile or a variation of the length of a load-tested pile shall be
allowed without additional load tests. The variations shall be limited to piles that derive their load capacity
predominantly from side skin friction and further limited to a change of the load capacity for a single pile of not
more than twenty (20) percent or to a change in length or not more than ten (10) percent. The basis for either
shall be the data developed by the engineering analysis. An increase in load capacity (not exceeding the twenty
(20) percent stipulated above) for a single pile shall be accompanied by an increase in the length of the loadtested pile. A decrease in the length (not exceeding the ten (10) percent stipulated above) of the load-tested pile
shall be accompanied by a decrease in the load capacity for a single pile.
(Ord. No. 22756, § 4, 5-17-06)

piles on surrounding property not to exceed three hundred (300) feet distant in any direction measured from the
location of the prior test, provided that these tests have been performed on the same type piles that are to be used
at the newer location and the similarity of sub soil conditions at both sites shall be established. The variations

movement of one (1) inch (25.4 mm) at the ground surface.
(Ord. No. 22756, § 4, 5-17-06)
Sec. 8-5-119.32. - Uplift capacity.
When required by the design, the uplift capacity of a single pile shall be determined in accordance with ASTM
D3689 or an approved method of analysis based upon a minimum factor of safety of three (3).
The maximum allowable uplift load shall be one-half (½) that load which produces an upward movement of the
pile but equal to the gross elastic extension of the pile plus 0.1 inch (2.5 mm). For pile groups subjected to uplift,
the allowable working uplift load for the group shall be the lesser of:
1.
The proposed individual pile uplift working load times the number of piles in the group, or
2.
Two-thirds ( 2/3 ) of the effective weight of the pile group and the soil contained within a block defined by the
perimeter of the group and the length of the pile.

The standards of this Code regarding the need for a pile foundation or the maximum design load capacity for the
particular type of pile may be superseded by a subsoil investigation which is performed in accordance with 1804
for a pile load test which is performed in accordance with 1805 provided the subsoil investigation or pile load
test is located within a 150 foot radius of the proposed foundation for a single boring or pile test. This distance
can be increased to a three hundred-foot radius for multi-soil borings or pile tests that recommend the same
design load.
It is within the discretion of the code official to waive the distance requirement provided a written request,
presented by a Louisiana Registered Civil Engineer experienced in soil mechanics, evidences soils similarity at
greater distances and demonstrates just causes for the waiver.
